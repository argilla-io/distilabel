    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Notus model on Inference Endpoints to create a legal preference dataset based on RAG instructions from the European AI Act. A full end-to-end example of how to use distilabel to leverage LLMs!\n",
    "\n",
    "[distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel) is an AI Feedback (AIF) framework that can generate and label datasets using LLMs, and can be used for many different use cases. Implemented with robustness, efficiency and scalability in mind, it allows anyone to build their synthetic datasets that can be used in many different scenarios. This tutorial shows an end-to-end example in which we will create a model expert in the new AI Act, to which we can make different types of questions and requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM model that we will fine-tune for this is [Notus 7B](https://argilla.io/blog/notus7b/), a fine-tuned version of Zephyr 7B that uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and AIF techniques to outperform its foundation model in several benchmarks, and is completely open-source.\n",

    "- Defining a custom generating task for a `distilabel` pipeline.\n",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\\n1.1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\\nThis explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down\\nharmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence\\n(AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and\\nsocietal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving\\nprediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery,\\nthe use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes\\nand provide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. ',\n",

However, the same\\nelements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also bring about\\nnew risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society. In light of the speed of\\ntechnological change and possible challenges, the EU is committed to strive for a balanced\\napproach. It is in the Union interest to preserve the EU’s technological leadership and to\\nensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed and functioning\\naccording to Union values, fundamental rights and principles.\\n',\n",
       " 'This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who\\nannounced in her political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission “A Union that strives for\\nmore”1, that the Commission would put forward legislation for a coordinated European\\napproach on the human and ethical implications of AI. Following on that announcement, on\\n19 February 2020 the Commission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach\\nto excellence and trust2. The White Paper sets out policy options on how to achieve the twin\\nobjective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain\\nuses of such technology. This proposal aims to implement the second objective for the\\ndevelopment of an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. ',\n",
       " 'The\\nproposal is based on EU values and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other\\nusers the confidence to embrace AI-based solutions, while encouraging businesses to develop\\nthem. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in society with the ultimate aim\\nof increasing human well-being. Rules for AI available in the Union market or otherwise\\naffecting people in the Union should therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that\\nthe technology is used in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including the respect\\nof fundamental rights. Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission\\nlaunched a broad stakeholder consultation, which was met with a great interest by a large\\nnumber of stakeholders who were largely supportive of regulatory intervention to address the\\nchallenges and concerns raised by the increasing use of AI.\\n',\n",
       " 'The proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament (EP) and the\\nEuropean Council, which have repeatedly expressed calls for legislative action to ensure a\\nwell-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both\\nbenefits and risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level.

Here are some ways AI can achieve these benefits:\\n\\n1. Prediction: AI can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. This enables it to make accurate predictions about future events, such as weather forecasting, stock market trends, and disease outbreaks. AI can also predict customer behavior, preferences, and needs, allowing businesses to tailor their products and services accordingly.\\n\\n2. Optimization: AI can optimize operations by automating routine tasks, reducing errors, and improving efficiency. For instance, AI-powered robots can perform repetitive tasks in manufacturing, while AI algorithms can optimize supply chain management, logistics, and transportation. AI can also optimize resource allocation, such as energy consumption, water usage, and waste management.\\n\\n3. Personalization: AI can personalize service delivery by analyzing customer data, preferences, and behavior. This enables businesses to offer customized recommendations, promotions, and offers, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. AI can also personalize content, such as news, music, and videos, based on\\n<text 2> \\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionise various industries by improving prediction, optimising operations, and personalising service delivery. Here are some ways AI can achieve these benefits:\\n\\n1. Prediction: AI can analyse vast amounts of data and identify patterns that are not visible to humans. This ability enables it to make accurate predictions about future trends and events. For instance, AI can predict weather patterns, stock market trends, and disease outbreaks. This information can help businesses and governments make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate risks.\\n\\n2. Optimisation: AI can optimise operations by identifying the most efficient ways to use resources. For example, AI-powered algorithms can optimise traffic flow, reduce energy consumption, and improve supply chain management. This results in cost savings, increased productivity, and reduced environmental impact.\\n\\n3. Personalisation: AI can analyse user data and preferences to provide personalised recommendations and experiences. For instance, AI-powered chatbots can understand user queries and provide relevant responses. AI can also recommend products and services based on user behaviour and preferences. This leads to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue.\\n\\n4. Healthcare: AI can improve patient outcomes by\\n\\n### Output \",\n",
