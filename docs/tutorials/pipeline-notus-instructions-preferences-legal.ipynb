    "[distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel) is an AI Feedback (AIF) framework that can generate and label datasets using LLMs, and can be used for many different use cases. Implemented with robustness, efficiency and scalability in mind, it allows anyone to build their synthetic datasets that can be used in many different scenarios. This tutorial shows an end-to-end example in which we will create a model expert in the new AI Act, to which we can make different types of questions and requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM model that we will fine-tune for this is [Notus 7B](https://argilla.io/blog/notus7b/), a fine-tuned version of Zephyr 7B that uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and AIF techniques to outperform its foundation model in several benchmarks, and is completely open-source.\n",

    "To conclude, we have gone through an end-to-end example of distilabel. We've set up an Inference Endpoint, defined a distilabel pipeline that extracts information from a PDF, created and manually reviewed the instruction and preference dataset created from that input. The final preference dataset is perfect for fine-tuning, and you can easily do this using the ArgillaTrainer from Argilla. Have a look at these resources if you want to go further:\n",
