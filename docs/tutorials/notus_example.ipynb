    "\n",
    "To kickstart this tutorial, let's see how to set up and endpoint for our Notus model. A HuggingFace endpoint is a service provided by HuggingFace that allows you to deploy and host your machine learning models for inference. This way, we'll have faster inference times, as these models will not run in our personal machines, but in HuggingFace servers. The endpoint of choice has a [Notus 7B instance](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/argilla/endpoints/aws-notus-7b-v1-4052) running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a quick example of how to use an inference endpoint. We have prepared an easy `Llama2QuestionAnsweringTask` to ask question to the model, in a very similar way as we talk with the LLMs using chatbots."

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\\n1.1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\\nThis explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down\\nharmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence\\n(AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and\\nsocietal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving\\nprediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery,\\nthe use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes\\nand provide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. Such\\naction is especially needed in high-impact sectors, including climate change, environment and\\nhealth, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, the same\\nelements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also bring about\\nnew risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society. In light of the speed of\\ntechnological change and possible challenges, the EU is committed to strive for a balanced\\napproach. It is in the Union interest to preserve the EU’s technological leadership and to\\nensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed and functioning\\naccording to Union values, fundamental rights and principles.\\nThis proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who\\nannounced in her political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission “A Union that strives for\\nmore”1, that the Commission would put forward legislation for a coordinated European\\napproach on the human and ethical implications of AI. Following on that announcement, on\\n19 February 2020 the Commission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach\\nto excellence and trust2. The White Paper sets out policy options on how to achieve the twin\\nobjective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain\\nuses of such technology. This proposal aims to implement the second objective for the\\ndevelopment of an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. The\\nproposal is based on EU values and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other\\nusers the confidence to embrace AI-based solutions, while encouraging businesses to develop\\nthem. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in society with the ultimate aim\\nof increasing human well-being. Rules for AI available in the Union market or otherwise\\naffecting people in the Union should therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that\\nthe technology is used in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including the respect\\nof fundamental rights. Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission\\nlaunched a broad stakeholder consultation, which was met with a great interest by a large\\nnumber of stakeholders who were largely supportive of regulatory intervention to address the\\nchallenges and concerns raised by the increasing use of AI.\\nThe proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament (EP) and the\\nEuropean Council, which have repeatedly expressed calls for legislative action to ensure a\\nwell-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both\\nbenefits and risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level. It supports the objective of\\nthe Union being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial\\n2 European Commission, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and\\ntrust, COM(2020) 65 final, 2020.\\x0cEN\\nintelligence as stated by the European Council3 and ensures the protection of ethical principles\\nas specifically requested by the European Parliament4.\\nIn 2017, the European Council called for a ‘sense of urgency to address emerging trends’\\nincluding ‘issues such as artificial intelligence …, while at the same time ensuring a high\\nlevel of data protection, digital rights and ethical standards’5. In its 2019 Conclusions on the\\nCoordinated Plan on the development and use of artificial intelligence Made in Europe6, the\\nCouncil further highlighted the importance of ensuring that European citizens’ rights are fully\\nrespected and called for a review of the existing relevant legislation to make it fit for purpose\\nfor the new opportunities and challenges raised by AI. The European Council has also called\\nfor a clear determination of the AI applications that should be considered high-risk7.\\nThe most recent Conclusions from 21 October 2020 further called for addressing the opacity,\\ncomplexity, bias, a certain degree of unpredictability and partially autonomous behaviour of\\ncertain AI systems, to ensure their compatibility with fundamental rights and to facilitate the\\nenforcement of legal rules8.\\nThe European Parliament has also undertaken a considerable amount of work in the area of\\nAI. In October 2020, it adopted a number of resolutions related to AI, including on ethics9,\\nliability10 and copyright11. In 2021, those were followed by resolutions on AI in criminal\\nmatters12 and in education, culture and the audio-visual sector13. The EP Resolution on a\\nFramework of Ethical Aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Related Technologies\\nspecifically recommends to the Commission to propose legislative action to harness the\\nopportunities and benefits of AI, but also to ensure protection of ethical principles. The\\nresolution includes a text of the legislative proposal for a regulation on ethical principles for\\nthe development, deployment and use of AI, robotics and related technologies. In accordance\\nwith the political commitment made by President von der Leyen in her Political Guidelines as\\nregards resolutions adopted by the European Parliament under Article 225 TFEU, this\\n3 European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions,\\nEUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6.\\n4 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a\\nframework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies,\\n2020/2012(INL).\\n5 European Council, European Council meeting (19 October 2017) – Conclusion EUCO 14/17, 2017, p.\\n8.\\n6 Council of the European Union, Artificial intelligence b) Conclusions on the coordinated plan on\\nartificial intelligence-Adoption 6177/19, 2019.\\n7 European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions\\nEUCO 13/20, 2020.\\n8 Council of the European Union, Presidency conclusions - The Charter of Fundamental Rights in the\\ncontext of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Change, 11481/20, 2020.\\n9 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on a framework of ethical aspects of artificial\\nintelligence, robotics and related technologies, 2020/2012(INL).\\n10 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on a civil liability regime for artificial intelligence,\\n2020/2014(INL).\\n11 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on intellectual property rights for the development\\nof artificial intelligence technologies, 2020/2015(INI).\\n12 European Parliament Draft Report, Artificial intelligence in criminal law and its use by the police and\\njudicial authorities in criminal matters, 2020/2016(INI).\\n13 European Parliament Draft Report, Artificial intelligence in education, culture and the audiovisual\\nsector, 2020/2017(INI). In that regard, the Commission has adopted the Digital Education Action Plan\\n2021-2027: Resetting education and training for the digital age, which foresees the development of\\nethical guidelines in AI and Data usage in education – Commission Communication COM(2020) 624\\nfinal.\\x0cEN\\nproposal takes into account the aforementioned resolution of the European Parliament in full\\nrespect of proportionality, subsidiarity and better law making principles.\\nAgainst this political context, the Commission puts forward the proposed regulatory\\nframework on Artificial Intelligence with the following specific objectives:\\n\\uf0b7 ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect\\nexisting law on fundamental rights and Union values;\\n\\uf0b7 ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI;\\n\\uf0b7 enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental\\nrights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems;\\n\\uf0b7 facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI\\napplications and prevent market fragmentation.\\nTo achieve those objectives, this proposal presents a balanced and proportionate horizontal\\nregulatory approach to AI that is limited to the minimum necessary requirements to address\\nthe risks and problems linked to AI, without unduly constraining or hindering technological\\ndevelopment or otherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing AI solutions on\\nthe market. The proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework. On the one hand, it is\\ncomprehensive and future-proof in its fundamental regulatory choices, including the\\nprinciple-based requirements that AI systems should comply with. On the other hand, it puts\\nin place a proportionate regulatory system centred on a well-defined risk-based regulatory\\napproach that does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade, whereby legal intervention is\\ntailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for concern or where such\\nconcern can reasonably be anticipated in the near future. At the same time, the legal\\nframework includes flexible mechanisms that enable it to be dynamically adapted as the\\ntechnology evolves and new concerning situations emerge.\\nThe proposal sets harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of\\nAI systems in the Union following a proportionate risk-based approach. It proposes a single\\nfuture-proof definition of AI. Certain particularly harmful AI practices are prohibited as\\ncontravening Union values, while specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed in relation\\nto certain uses of remote biometric identification systems for the purpose of law enforcement.\\nThe proposal lays down a solid risk methodology to define “high-risk” AI systems that pose\\nsignificant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons. Those AI systems\\nwill have to comply with a set of horizontal mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI and\\nfollow conformity assessment procedures before those systems can be placed on the Union\\nmarket. Predictable, proportionate and clear obligations are also placed on providers and users\\nof those systems to ensure safety and respect of existing legislation protecting fundamental\\nrights throughout the whole AI systems’ lifecycle. For some specific AI systems, only\\nminimum transparency obligations are proposed, in particular when chatbots or ‘deep fakes’\\nare used.\\nThe proposed rules will be enforced through a governance system at Member States level,\\nbuilding on already existing structures, and a cooperation mechanism at Union level with the\\nestablishment of a European Artificial Intelligence Board. Additional measures are also\\nproposed to support innovation, in particular through AI regulatory sandboxes and other\\nmeasures to reduce the regulatory burden and to support Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises\\n(‘SMEs’) and start-ups.\\x0cEN\\n1.2. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\\nThe horizontal nature of the proposal requires full consistency with existing Union legislation\\napplicable to sectors where high-risk AI systems are already used or likely to be used in the\\nnear future.\\nConsistency is also ensured with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the existing\\nsecondary Union legislation on data protection, consumer protection, non-discrimination and\\ngender equality. The proposal is without prejudice and complements the General Data\\nProtection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Law Enforcement Directive\\n(Directive (EU) 2016/680) with a set of harmonised rules applicable to the design,\\ndevelopment and use of certain high-risk AI systems and restrictions on certain uses of remote\\nbiometric identification systems. Furthermore, the proposal complements existing Union law\\non non-discrimination with specific requirements that aim to minimise the risk of algorithmic\\ndiscrimination, in particular in relation to the design and the quality of data sets used for the\\ndevelopment of AI systems complemented with obligations for testing, risk management,\\ndocumentation and human oversight throughout the AI systems’ lifecycle. The proposal is\\nwithout prejudice to the application of Union competition law.\\nAs regards high-risk AI systems which are safety components of products, this proposal will\\nbe integrated into the existing sectoral safety legislation to ensure consistency, avoid\\nduplications and minimise additional burdens. In particular, as regards high-risk AI systems\\nrelated to products covered by the New Legislative Framework (NLF) legislation (e.g.\\nmachinery, medical devices, toys), the requirements for AI systems set out in this proposal\\nwill be checked as part of the existing conformity assessment procedures under the relevant\\nNLF legislation. With regard to the interplay of requirements, while the safety risks specific\\nto AI systems are meant to be covered by the requirements of this proposal, NLF legislation\\naims at ensuring the overall safety of the final product and therefore may contain specific\\nrequirements regarding the safe integration of an AI system into the final product. The\\nproposal for a Machinery Regulation, which is adopted on the same day as this proposal fully\\nreflects this approach. As regards high-risk AI systems related to products covered by relevant\\nOld Approach legislation (e.g. aviation, cars), this proposal would not directly apply.\\nHowever, the ex-ante essential requirements for high-risk AI systems set out in this proposal\\nwill have to be taken into account when adopting relevant implementing or delegated\\nlegislation under those acts.\\nAs regards AI systems provided or used by regulated credit institutions, the authorities\\nresponsible for the supervision of the Union’s financial services legislation should be\\ndesignated as competent authorities for supervising the requirements in this proposal to ensure\\na coherent enforcement of the obligations under this proposal and the Union’s financial\\nservices legislation where AI systems are to some extent implicitly regulated in relation to the\\ninternal governance system of credit institutions. To further enhance consistency, the\\nconformity assessment procedure and some of the providers’ procedural obligations under this\\nproposal are integrated into the procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the\\nactivity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision14.\\n14 Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the\\nactivity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms,\\namending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC Text with EEA\\nrelevance, OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338–436.\\x0cEN\\nThis proposal is also consistent with the applicable Union legislation on services, including on\\nintermediary services regulated by the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC15 and the\\nCommission’s recent proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA)16.\\nIn relation to AI systems that are components of large-scale IT systems in the Area of\\nFreedom, Security and Justice managed by the European Union Agency for the Operational\\nManagement of Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA), the proposal will not apply to those AI\\nsystems that have been placed on the market or put into service before one year has elapsed\\nfrom the date of application of this Regulation, unless the replacement or amendment of those\\nlegal acts leads to a significant change in the design or intended purpose of the AI system or\\nAI systems concerned.\\n1.3. Consistency with other Union policies\\nThe proposal is part of a wider comprehensive package of measures that address problems\\nposed by the development and use of AI, as examined in the White Paper on AI. Consistency\\nand complementarity is therefore ensured with other ongoing or planned initiatives of the\\nCommission that also aim to address those problems, including the revision of sectoral\\nproduct legislation (e.g. the Machinery Directive, the General Product Safety Directive) and\\ninitiatives that address liability issues related to new technologies, including AI systems.\\nThose initiatives will build on and complement this proposal in order to bring legal clarity and\\nfoster the development of an ecosystem of trust in AI in Europe.\\nThe proposal is also coherent with the Commission’s overall digital strategy in its\\ncontribution to promoting technology that works for people, one of the three main pillars of\\nthe policy orientation and objectives announced in the Communication ‘Shaping Europe\\'s\\ndigital future’17. It lays down a coherent, effective and proportionate framework to ensure AI\\nis developed in ways that respect people’s rights and earn their trust, making Europe fit for the\\ndigital age and turning the next ten years into the Digital Decade18.\\nFurthermore, the promotion of AI-driven innovation is closely linked to the Data\\nGovernance Act19, the Open Data Directive20 and other initiatives under the EU strategy\\nfor data21, which will establish trusted mechanisms and services for the re-use, sharing and\\npooling of data that are essential for the development of data-driven AI models of high\\nquality.\\nThe proposal also strengthens significantly the Union’s role to help shape global norms and\\nstandards and promote trustworthy AI that is consistent with Union values and interests. It\\nprovides the Union with a powerful basis to engage further with its external partners,\\nincluding third countries, and at international fora on issues relating to AI.\\n15 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal\\naspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market\\n(\\'Directive on electronic commerce\\'), OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1–16.\\n16 See Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\\non a Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act) and amending Directive 2000/31/EC\\nCOM/2020/825 final.\\n17 Communication from the Commission, Shaping Europe\\'s Digital Future, COM/2020/67 final.\\n18 2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade.\\n19 Proposal for a Regulation on European data governance (Data Governance Act) COM/2020/767.\\n20 Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data\\nand the re-use of public sector information, PE/28/2019/REV/1, OJ L 172, 26.6.2019, p. 56–83.\\n21 Commission Communication, A European strategy for data COM/2020/66 final.\\x0cEN\\n2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\\n2.1. Legal basis\\nThe legal basis for the proposal is in the first place Article 114 of the Treaty on the\\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the adoption of measures to\\nensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\\nThis proposal constitutes a core part of the EU digital single market strategy. The primary\\nobjective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by setting\\nharmonised rules in particular on the development, placing on the Union market and the use\\nof products and services making use of AI technologies or provided as stand-alone AI\\nsystems. Some Member States are already considering national rules to ensure that AI is safe\\nand is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. This will likely\\nlead to two main problems: i) a fragmentation of the internal market on essential elements\\nregarding in particular the requirements for the AI products and services, their marketing,\\ntheir use, the liability and the supervision by public authorities, and ii) the substantial\\ndiminishment of legal certainty for both providers and users of AI systems on how existing\\nand new rules will apply to those systems in the Union. Given the wide circulation of products\\nand services across borders, these two problems can be best solved through EU harmonizing\\nlegislation.\\nIndeed, the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and\\ndevelopment of certain AI systems before they are placed on the market that will be further\\noperationalised through harmonised technical standards. The proposal also addresses the\\nsituation after AI systems have been placed on the market by harmonising the way in which\\nex-post controls are conducted.\\nIn addition, considering that this proposal contains certain specific rules on the protection of\\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data, notably restrictions of the use of AI\\nsystems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the\\npurpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this regulation, in as far as those specific\\nrules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU.\\n2.2. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\\nThe nature of AI, which often relies on large and varied datasets and which may be embedded\\nin any product or service circulating freely within the internal market, entails that the\\nobjectives of this proposal cannot be effectively achieved by Member States alone.\\nFurthermore, an emerging patchwork of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the\\nseamless circulation of products and services related to AI systems across the EU and will be\\nineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values\\nacross the different Member States. National approaches in addressing the problems will only\\ncreate additional legal uncertainty and barriers, and will slow market uptake of AI.\\nThe objectives of this proposal can be better achieved at Union level to avoid a further\\nfragmentation of the Single Market into potentially contradictory national frameworks\\npreventing the free circulation of goods and services embedding AI. A solid European\\nregulatory framework for trustworthy AI will also ensure a level playing field and protect all\\npeople, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI. Only\\ncommon action at Union level can also protect the Union’s digital sovereignty and leverage\\nits tools and regulatory powers to shape global rules and standards.\\x0cEN\\nThe proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and necessary to\\nachieve its objectives, since it follows a risk-based approach and imposes regulatory burdens\\nonly when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety. For\\nother, non-high-risk AI systems, only very limited transparency obligations are imposed, for\\nexample in terms of the provision of information to flag the use of an AI system when\\ninteracting with humans. For high-risk AI systems, the requirements of high quality data,\\ndocumentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness, are\\nstrictly necessary to mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and safety posed by AI and that\\nare not covered by other existing legal frameworks. Harmonised standards and supporting\\nguidance and compliance tools will assist providers and users in complying with the\\nrequirements laid down by the proposal and minimise their costs. The costs incurred by\\noperators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the economic and reputational\\nbenefits that operators can expect from this proposal.\\n2.4. Choice of the instrument\\nThe choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform\\napplication of the new rules, such as definition of AI, the prohibition of certain harmful AI-\\nenabled practices and the classification of certain AI systems. The direct applicability of a\\nRegulation, in accordance with Article 288 TFEU, will reduce legal fragmentation and\\nfacilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI systems. It\\nwill do so, in particular, by introducing a harmonised set of core requirements with regard to\\nAI systems classified as high-risk and obligations for providers and users of those systems,\\nimproving the protection of fundamental rights and providing legal certainty for operators and\\nconsumers alike.\\nAt the same time, the provisions of the regulation are not overly prescriptive and leave room\\nfor different levels of Member State action for elements that do not undermine the objectives\\nof the initiative, in particular the internal organisation of the market surveillance system and\\nthe uptake of measures to foster innovation.\\n3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER\\nCONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\\n3.1. Stakeholder consultation\\nThis proposal is the result of extensive consultation with all major stakeholders, in which the\\ngeneral principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the\\nCommission were applied.\\nAn online public consultation was launched on 19 February 2020 along with the publication\\nof the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and ran until 14 June 2020. The objective of that\\nconsultation was to collect views and opinions on the White Paper. It targeted all interested\\nstakeholders from the public and private sectors, including governments, local authorities,\\ncommercial and non-commercial organisations, social partners, experts, academics and\\ncitizens. After analysing all the responses received, the Commission published a summary\\noutcome and the individual responses on its website22.\\nIn total, 1215 contributions were received, of which 352 were from companies or business\\norganisations/associations, 406 from individuals (92%individuals from EU ), 152 on behalf of\\n22 See all consultation results here.\\x0cEN\\nacademic/research institutions, and 73 from public authorities. Civil society’s voices were\\nrepresented by 160 respondents (among which 9 consumers’ organisations, 129 non-\\ngovernmental organisations and 22 trade unions), 72 respondents contributed as ‘others’. Of\\nthe 352 business and industry representatives, 222 were companies and business\\nrepresentatives, 41.5% of which were micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The rest\\nwere business associations. Overall, 84% of business and industry replies came from the EU-\\n27. Depending on the question, between 81 and 598 of the respondents used the free text\\noption to insert comments. Over 450 position papers were submitted through the EU Survey\\nwebsite, either in addition to questionnaire answers (over 400) or as stand-alone contributions\\n(over 50).\\nOverall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders on a need for action. A large\\nmajority of stakeholders agree that legislative gaps exist or that new legislation is needed.\\nHowever, several stakeholders warn the Commission to avoid duplication, conflicting\\nobligations and overregulation. There were many comments underlining the importance of a\\ntechnology neutral and proportionate regulatory framework.\\nStakeholders mostly requested a narrow, clear and precise definition for AI. Stakeholders also\\nhighlighted that besides the clarification of the term of AI, it is important to define ‘risk’,\\n‘high-risk’, ‘low-risk’, ‘remote biometric identification’ and ‘harm’.\\nMost of the respondents are explicitly in favour of the risk-based approach. Using a risk-based\\nframework was considered a better option than blanket regulation of all AI systems. The types\\nof risks and threats should be based on a sector-by-sector and case-by-case approach. Risks\\nalso should be calculated taking into account the impact on rights and safety.\\nRegulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of AI and are welcomed by\\ncertain stakeholders, especially the Business Associations.\\nAmong those who formulated their opinion on the enforcement models, more than 50%,\\nespecially from the business associations, were in favour of a combination of an ex-ante risk\\nself-assessment and an ex-post enforcement for high-risk AI systems.\\n3.2. Collection and use of expertise\\nThe proposal builds on two years of analysis and close involvement of stakeholders, including\\nacademics, businesses, social partners, non-governmental organisations, Member States and\\ncitizens. The preparatory work started in 2018 with the setting up of a High-Level Expert\\nGroup on AI (HLEG) which had an inclusive and broad composition of 52 well-known\\nexperts tasked to advise the Commission on the implementation of the Commission’s Strategy\\non Artificial Intelligence. In April 2019, the Commission supported23 the key requirements set\\nout in the HLEG ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI24, which had been revised to take into\\naccount more than 500 submissions from stakeholders. The key requirements reflect a\\nwidespread and common approach, as evidenced by a plethora of ethical codes and principles\\ndeveloped by many private and public organisations in Europe and beyond, that AI\\ndevelopment and use should be guided by certain essential value-oriented principles. The\\nAssessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI)25 made those requirements\\noperational in a piloting process with over 350 organisations.\\n23 European Commission, Building Trust in Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence, COM(2019) 168.\\n24 HLEG, Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, 2019.\\n25 HLEG, Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) for self-assessment, 2020.\\x0cEN\\nIn addition, the AI Alliance26 was formed as a platform for approximately 4000 stakeholders\\nto debate the technological and societal implications of AI, culminating in a yearly AI\\nAssembly.\\nThe White Paper on AI further developed this inclusive approach, inciting comments from\\nmore than 1250 stakeholders, including over 450 additional position papers. As a result, the\\nCommission published an Inception Impact Assessment, which in turn attracted more than\\n130 comments27. Additional stakeholder workshops and events were also organised the\\nresults of which support the analysis in the impact assessment and the policy choices made in\\nthis proposal28. An external study was also procured to feed into the impact assessment.\\n3.3. Impact assessment\\nIn line with its “Better Regulation” policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment\\nfor this proposal examined by the Commission\\'s Regulatory Scrutiny Board. A meeting with\\nthe Regulatory Scrutiny Board was held on 16 December 2020, which was followed by a\\nnegative opinion. After substantial revision of the impact assessment to address the comments\\nand a resubmission of the impact assessment, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive\\nopinion on 21 March 2021. The opinions of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, the\\nrecommendations and an explanation of how they have been taken into account are presented\\nin Annex 1 of the impact assessment.\\nThe Commission examined different policy options to achieve the general objective of the\\nproposal, which is to ensure the proper functioning of the single market by creating the\\nconditions for the development and use of trustworthy AI in the Union.\\nFour policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were assessed:\\n\\uf0b7 Option 1: EU legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling scheme;\\n\\uf0b7 Option 2: a sectoral, “ad-hoc” approach;\\n\\uf0b7 Option 3: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk-\\nbased approach;\\n\\uf0b7 Option 3+: Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk-\\nbased approach + codes of conduct for non-high-risk AI systems;\\n\\uf0b7 Option 4: Horizontal EU legislative instrument establishing mandatory\\nrequirements for all AI systems, irrespective of the risk they pose.\\nAccording to the Commission\\'s established methodology, each policy option was evaluated\\nagainst economic and societal impacts, with a particular focus on impacts on fundamental\\nrights. The preferred option is option 3+, a regulatory framework for high-risk AI systems\\nonly, with the possibility for all providers of non-high-risk AI systems to follow a code of\\nconduct. The requirements will concern data, documentation and traceability, provision of\\ninformation and transparency, human oversight and robustness and accuracy and would be\\nmandatory for high-risk AI systems. Companies that introduced codes of conduct for other AI\\nsystems would do so voluntarily.\\n26 The AI Alliance is a multi-stakeholder forum launched in June 2018, AI Alliance\\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-ai-alliance\\n27 European Commission, Inception Impact Assessment For a Proposal for a legal act of the European\\nParliament and the Council laying down requirements for Artificial Intelligence.\\n28 For details of all the consultations that have been carried out see Annex 2 of the impact assessment.\\x0cEN\\nThe preferred option was considered suitable to address in the most effective way the\\nobjectives of this proposal. By requiring a restricted yet effective set of actions from AI\\ndevelopers and users, the preferred option limits the risks of violation of fundamental rights\\nand safety of people and foster effective supervision and enforcement, by targeting the\\nrequirements only to systems where there is a high risk that such violations could occur. As a\\nresult, that option keeps compliance costs to a minimum, thus avoiding an unnecessary\\nslowing of uptake due to higher prices and compliance costs. In order to address possible\\ndisadvantages for SMEs, this option includes several provisions to support their compliance\\nand reduce their costs, including creation of regulatory sandboxes and obligation to consider\\nSMEs interests when setting fees related to conformity assessment.\\nThe preferred option will increase people’s trust in AI, companies will gain in legal certainty,\\nand Member States will see no reason to take unilateral action that could fragment the single\\nmarket. As a result of higher demand due to higher trust, more available offers due to legal\\ncertainty, and the absence of obstacles to cross-border movement of AI systems, the single\\nmarket for AI will likely flourish. The European Union will continue to develop a fast-\\ngrowing AI ecosystem of innovative services and products embedding AI technology or\\nstand-alone AI systems, resulting in increased digital autonomy.\\nBusinesses or public authorities that develop or use AI applications that constitute a high risk\\nfor the safety or fundamental rights of citizens would have to comply with specific\\nrequirements and obligations. Compliance with these requirements would imply costs\\namounting to approximately EUR € 6000 to EUR € 7000 for the supply of an average high-\\nrisk AI system of around EUR € 170000 by 2025. For AI users, there would also be the\\nannual cost for the time spent on ensuring human oversight where this is appropriate,\\ndepending on the use case. Those have been estimated at approximately EUR € 5000 to EUR\\n€ 8000 per year. Verification costs could amount to another EUR € 3000 to EUR € 7500 for\\nsuppliers of high-risk AI. Businesses or public authorities that develop or use any AI\\napplications not classified as high risk would only have minimal obligations of information.\\nHowever, they could choose to join others and together adopt a code of conduct to follow\\nsuitable requirements, and to ensure that their AI systems are trustworthy. In such a case,\\ncosts would be at most as high as for high-risk AI systems, but most probably lower.\\nThe impacts of the policy options on different categories of stakeholders (economic operators/\\nbusiness; conformity assessment bodies, standardisation bodies and other public bodies;\\nindividuals/citizens; researchers) are explained in detail in Annex 3 of the Impact assessment\\nsupporting this proposal.\\n3.4. Regulatory fitness and simplification\\nThis proposal lays down obligation that will apply to providers and users of high-risk AI\\nsystems. For providers who develop and place such systems on the Union market, it will\\ncreate legal certainty and ensure that no obstacle to the cross-border provision of AI-related\\nservices and products emerge. For companies using AI, it will promote trust among their\\ncustomers. For national public administrations, it will promote public trust in the use of AI\\nand strengthen enforcement mechanisms (by introducing a European coordination\\nmechanism, providing for appropriate capacities, and facilitating audits of the AI systems\\nwith new requirements for documentation, traceability and transparency). Moreover, the\\nframework will envisage specific measures supporting innovation, including regulatory\\nsandboxes and specific measures supporting small-scale users and providers of high-risk AI\\nsystems to comply with the new rules.\\nThe proposal also specifically aims at strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial\\nbasis in AI. Full consistency is ensured with existing sectoral Union legislation applicable to\\x0cEN\\nAI systems (e.g. on products and services) that will bring further clarity and simplify the\\nenforcement of the new rules.\\n3.5. Fundamental rights\\nThe use of AI with its specific characteristics (e.g. opacity, complexity, dependency on data,\\nautonomous behaviour) can adversely affect a number of fundamental rights enshrined in the\\nEU Charter of Fundamental Rights (‘the Charter’). This proposal seeks to ensure a high level\\nof protection for those fundamental rights and aims to address various sources of risks\\nthrough a clearly defined risk-based approach. With a set of requirements for trustworthy AI\\nand proportionate obligations on all value chain participants, the proposal will enhance and\\npromote the protection of the rights protected by the Charter: the right to human dignity\\n(Article 1), respect for private life and protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8), non-\\ndiscrimination (Article 21) and equality between women and men (Article 23). It aims to\\nprevent a chilling effect on the rights to freedom of expression (Article 11) and freedom of\\nassembly (Article 12), to ensure protection of the right to an effective remedy and to a fair\\ntrial, the rights of defence and the presumption of innocence (Articles 47 and 48), as well as\\nthe general principle of good administration. Furthermore, as applicable in certain domains,\\nthe proposal will positively affect the rights of a number of special groups, such as the\\nworkers’ rights to fair and just working conditions (Article 31), a high level of consumer\\nprotection (Article 28), the rights of the child (Article 24) and the integration of persons with\\ndisabilities (Article 26). The right to a high level of environmental protection and the\\nimprovement of the quality of the environment (Article 37) is also relevant, including in\\nrelation to the health and safety of people. The obligations for ex ante testing, risk\\nmanagement and human oversight will also facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights\\nby minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as\\neducation and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary. In\\ncase infringements of fundamental rights still happen, effective redress for affected persons\\nwill be made possible by ensuring transparency and traceability of the AI systems coupled\\nwith strong ex post controls.\\nThis proposal imposes some restrictions on the freedom to conduct business (Article 16) and\\nthe freedom of art and science (Article 13) to ensure compliance with overriding reasons of\\npublic interest such as health, safety, consumer protection and the protection of other\\nfundamental rights (‘responsible innovation’) when high-risk AI technology is developed and\\nused. Those restrictions are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to prevent\\nand mitigate serious safety risks and likely infringements of fundamental rights.\\nThe increased transparency obligations will also not disproportionately affect the right to\\nprotection of intellectual property (Article 17(2)), since they will be limited only to the\\nminimum necessary information for individuals to exercise their right to an effective remedy\\nand to the necessary transparency towards supervision and enforcement authorities, in line\\nwith their mandates. Any disclosure of information will be carried out in compliance with\\nrelevant legislation in the field, including Directive 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed\\nknow-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and\\ndisclosure. When public authorities and notified bodies need to be given access to confidential\\ninformation or source code to examine compliance with substantial obligations, they are\\nplaced under binding confidentiality obligations.\\n4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\\nMember States will have to designate supervisory authorities in charge of implementing the\\nlegislative requirements. Their supervisory function could build on existing arrangements, for\\x0cEN\\nexample regarding conformity assessment bodies or market surveillance, but would require\\nsufficient technological expertise and human and financial resources. Depending on the pre-\\nexisting structure in each Member State, this could amount to 1 to 25 Full Time Equivalents\\nper Member State.\\nA detailed overview of the costs involved is provided in the ‘financial statement’ linked to\\nthis proposal.\\n5. OTHER ELEMENTS\\n5.1. Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\\nProviding for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to ensure that the\\nproposal will be effective in achieving its specific objectives. The Commission will be in\\ncharge of monitoring the effects of the proposal. It will establish a system for registering\\nstand-alone high-risk AI applications in a public EU-wide database. This registration will also\\nenable competent authorities, users and other interested people to verify if the high-risk AI\\nsystem complies with the requirements laid down in the proposal and to exercise enhanced\\noversight over those AI systems posing high risks to fundamental rights. To feed this\\ndatabase, AI providers will be obliged to provide meaningful information about their systems\\nand the conformity assessment carried out on those systems.\\nMoreover, AI providers will be obliged to inform national competent authorities about serious\\nincidents or malfunctioning that constitute a breach of fundamental rights obligations as soon\\nas they become aware of them, as well as any recalls or withdrawals of AI systems from the\\nmarket. National competent authorities will then investigate the incidents/or malfunctioning,\\ncollect all the necessary information and regularly transmit it to the Commission with\\nadequate metadata. The Commission will complement this information on the incidents by a\\ncomprehensive analysis of the overall market for AI.\\nThe Commission will publish a report evaluating and reviewing the proposed AI framework\\nfive years following the date on which it becomes applicable.\\n5.2. Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\\n5.2.1. SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS (TITLE I)\\nTitle I defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of application of the new\\nrules that cover the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems. It also\\nsets out the definitions used throughout the instrument. The definition of AI system in the\\nlegal framework aims to be as technology neutral and future proof as possible, taking into\\naccount the fast technological and market developments related to AI. In order to provide the\\nneeded legal certainty, Title I is complemented by Annex I, which contains a detailed list of\\napproaches and techniques for the development of AI to be adapted by the Commission in line\\nwith new technological developments. Key participants across the AI value chain are also\\nclearly defined such as providers and users of AI systems that cover both public and private\\noperators to ensure a level playing field.\\n5.2.2. PROHIBITED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES (TITLE II)\\nTitle II establishes a list of prohibited AI. The regulation follows a risk-based approach,\\ndifferentiating between uses of AI that create (i) an unacceptable risk, (ii) a high risk, and (iii)\\nlow or minimal risk. The list of prohibited practices in Title II comprises all those AI systems\\nwhose use is considered unacceptable as contravening Union values, for instance by violating\\nfundamental rights. The prohibitions covers practices that have a significant potential to\\nmanipulate persons through subliminal techniques beyond their consciousness or exploit\\x0cEN\\nvulnerabilities of specific vulnerable groups such as children or persons with disabilities in\\norder to materially distort their behaviour in a manner that is likely to cause them or another\\nperson psychological or physical harm. Other manipulative or exploitative practices affecting\\nadults that might be facilitated by AI systems could be covered by the existing data\\nprotection, consumer protection and digital service legislation that guarantee that natural\\npersons are properly informed and have free choice not to be subject to profiling or other\\npractices that might affect their behaviour. The proposal also prohibits AI-based social\\nscoring for general purposes done by public authorities. Finally, the use of ‘real time’ remote\\nbiometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law\\nenforcement is also prohibited unless certain limited exceptions apply.\\n5.2.3. HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS (TITLE III)\\nTitle III contains specific rules for AI systems that create a high risk to the health and safety\\nor fundamental rights of natural persons. In line with a risk-based approach, those high-risk\\nAI systems are permitted on the European market subject to compliance with certain\\nmandatory requirements and an ex-ante conformity assessment. The classification of an AI\\nsystem as high-risk is based on the intended purpose of the AI system, in line with existing\\nproduct safety legislation. Therefore, the classification as high-risk does not only depend on\\nthe function performed by the AI system, but also on the specific purpose and modalities for\\nwhich that system is used.\\nChapter 1 of Title III sets the classification rules and identifies two main categories of high-\\nrisk AI systems:\\n\\uf0b7 AI systems intended to be used as safety component of products that are subject to\\nthird party ex-ante conformity assessment;\\n\\uf0b7 other stand-alone AI systems with mainly fundamental rights implications that are\\nexplicitly listed in Annex III.\\nThis list of high-risk AI systems in Annex III contains a limited number of AI systems whose\\nrisks have already materialised or are likely to materialise in the near future. To ensure that\\nthe regulation can be adjusted to emerging uses and applications of AI, the Commission may\\nexpand the list of high-risk AI systems used within certain pre-defined areas, by applying a\\nset of criteria and risk assessment methodology.\\nChapter 2 sets out the legal requirements for high-risk AI systems in relation to data and data\\ngovernance, documentation and recording keeping, transparency and provision of information\\nto users, human oversight, robustness, accuracy and security. The proposed minimum\\nrequirements are already state-of-the-art for many diligent operators and the result of two\\nyears of preparatory work, derived from the Ethics Guidelines of the HLEG29, piloted by\\nmore than 350 organisations30. They are also largely consistent with other international\\nrecommendations and principles, which ensures that the proposed AI framework is\\ncompatible with those adopted by the EU’s international trade partners. The precise technical\\nsolutions to achieve compliance with those requirements may be provided by standards or by\\nother technical specifications or otherwise be developed in accordance with general\\nengineering or scientific knowledge at the discretion of the provider of the AI system. This\\nflexibility is particularly important, because it allows providers of AI systems to choose the\\n29 High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, 2019.\\n30 They were also endorsed by the Commission in its 2019 Communication on human-centric approach to\\nAI.\\x0cEN\\nway to meet their requirements, taking into account the state-of-the-art and technological and\\nscientific progress in this field.\\nChapter 3 places a clear set of horizontal obligations on providers of high-risk AI systems.\\nProportionate obligations are also placed on users and other participants across the AI value\\nchain (e.g., importers, distributors, authorized representatives).\\nChapter 4 sets the framework for notified bodies to be involved as independent third parties in\\nconformity assessment procedures, while Chapter 5 explains in detail the conformity\\nassessment procedures to be followed for each type of high-risk AI system. The conformity\\nassessment approach aims to minimise the burden for economic operators as well as for\\nnotified bodies, whose capacity needs to be progressively ramped up over time. AI systems\\nintended to be used as safety components of products that are regulated under the New\\nLegislative Framework legislation (e.g. machinery, toys, medical devices, etc.) will be subject\\nto the same ex-ante and ex-post compliance and enforcement mechanisms of the products of\\nwhich they are a component. The key difference is that the ex-ante and ex-post mechanisms\\nwill ensure compliance not only with the requirements established by sectorial legislation, but\\nalso with the requirements established by this regulation.\\nAs regards stand-alone high-risk AI systems that are referred to in Annex III, a new\\ncompliance and enforcement system will be established. This follows the model of the New\\nLegislative Framework legislation implemented through internal control checks by the\\nproviders with the exception of remote biometric identification systems that would be subject\\nto third party conformity assessment. A comprehensive ex-ante conformity assessment\\nthrough internal checks, combined with a strong ex-post enforcement, could be an effective\\nand reasonable solution for those systems, given the early phase of the regulatory intervention\\nand the fact the AI sector is very innovative and expertise for auditing is only now being\\naccumulated. An assessment through internal checks for ‘stand-alone’ high-risk AI systems\\nwould require a full, effective and properly documented ex ante compliance with all\\nrequirements of the regulation and compliance with robust quality and risk management\\nsystems and post-market monitoring. After the provider has performed the relevant\\nconformity assessment, it should register those stand-alone high-risk AI systems in an EU\\ndatabase that will be managed by the Commission to increase public transparency and\\noversight and strengthen ex post supervision by competent authorities. By contrast, for\\nreasons of consistency with the existing product safety legislation, the conformity assessments\\nof AI systems that are safety components of products will follow a system with third party\\nconformity assessment procedures already established under the relevant sectoral product\\nsafety legislation. New ex ante re-assessments of the conformity will be needed in case of\\nsubstantial modifications to the AI systems (and notably changes which go beyond what is\\npre-determined by the provider in its technical documentation and checked at the moment of\\nthe ex-ante conformity assessment).\\n5.2.4. TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS (TITLE IV)\\nTitle IV concerns certain AI systems to take account of the specific risks of manipulation they\\npose. Transparency obligations will apply for systems that (i) interact with humans, (ii) are\\nused to detect emotions or determine association with (social) categories based on biometric\\ndata, or (iii) generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes’). When persons interact with an AI\\nsystem or their emotions or characteristics are recognised through automated means, people\\nmust be informed of that circumstance. If an AI system is used to generate or manipulate\\nimage, audio or video content that appreciably resembles authentic content, there should be an\\nobligation to disclose that the content is generated through automated means, subject to\\x0cEN\\nexceptions for legitimate purposes (law enforcement, freedom of expression). This allows\\npersons to make informed choices or step back from a given situation.\\n5.2.5. MEASURES IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION (TITLE V)\\nTitle V contributes to the objective to create a legal framework that is innovation-friendly,\\nfuture-proof and resilient to disruption. To that end, it encourages national competent\\nauthorities to set up regulatory sandboxes and sets a basic framework in terms of governance,\\nsupervision and liability. AI regulatory sandboxes establish a controlled environment to test\\ninnovative technologies for a limited time on the basis of a testing plan agreed with the\\ncompetent authorities. Title V also contains measures to reduce the regulatory burden on\\nSMEs and start-ups.\\n5.2.6. GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION (TITLES VI, VII AND VII)\\nTitle VI sets up the governance systems at Union and national level. At Union level, the\\nproposal establishes a European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’), composed of\\nrepresentatives from the Member States and the Commission. The Board will facilitate a\\nsmooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this regulation by contributing to the\\neffective cooperation of the national supervisory authorities and the Commission and\\nproviding advice and expertise to the Commission. It will also collect and share best practices\\namong the Member States.\\nAt national level, Member States will have to designate one or more national competent\\nauthorities and, among them, the national supervisory authority, for the purpose of\\nsupervising the application and implementation of the regulation. The European Data\\nProtection Supervisor will act as the competent authority for the supervision of the Union\\ninstitutions, agencies and bodies when they fall within the scope of this regulation.\\nTitle VII aims to facilitate the monitoring work of the Commission and national authorities\\nthrough the establishment of an EU-wide database for stand-alone high-risk AI systems with\\nmainly fundamental rights implications. The database will be operated by the Commission\\nand provided with data by the providers of the AI systems, who will be required to register\\ntheir systems before placing them on the market or otherwise putting them into service.\\nTitle VIII sets out the monitoring and reporting obligations for providers of AI systems with\\nregard to post-market monitoring and reporting and investigating on AI-related incidents and\\nmalfunctioning. Market surveillance authorities would also control the market and investigate\\ncompliance with the obligations and requirements for all high-risk AI systems already placed\\non the market. Market surveillance authorities would have all powers under Regulation (EU)\\n2019/1020 on market surveillance. Ex-post enforcement should ensure that once the AI\\nsystem has been put on the market, public authorities have the powers and resources to\\nintervene in case AI systems generate unexpected risks, which warrant rapid action. They will\\nalso monitor compliance of operators with their relevant obligations under the regulation. The\\nproposal does not foresee the automatic creation of any additional bodies or authorities at\\nMember State level. Member States may therefore appoint (and draw upon the expertise of)\\nexisting sectorial authorities, who would be entrusted also with the powers to monitor and\\nenforce the provisions of the regulation.\\nAll this is without prejudice to the existing system and allocation of powers of ex-post\\nenforcement of obligations regarding fundamental rights in the Member States. When\\nnecessary for their mandate, existing supervision and enforcement authorities will also have\\nthe power to request and access any documentation maintained following this regulation and,\\nwhere needed, request market surveillance authorities to organise testing of the high-risk AI\\nsystem through technical means.\\x0cEN\\n5.2.7. CODES OF CONDUCT (TITLE IX)\\nTitle IX creates a framework for the creation of codes of conduct, which aim to encourage\\nproviders of non-high-risk AI systems to apply voluntarily the mandatory requirements for\\nhigh-risk AI systems (as laid out in Title III). Providers of non-high-risk AI systems may\\ncreate and implement the codes of conduct themselves. Those codes may also include\\nvoluntary commitments related, for example, to environmental sustainability, accessibility for\\npersons with disability, stakeholders’ participation in the design and development of AI\\nsystems, and diversity of development teams.\\n5.2.8. FINAL PROVISIONS (TITLES X, XI AND XII)\\nTitle X emphasizes the obligation of all parties to respect the confidentiality of information\\nand data and sets out rules for the exchange of information obtained during the\\nimplementation of the regulation. Title X also includes measures to ensure the effective\\nimplementation of the regulation through effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties for\\ninfringements of the provisions.\\nTitle XI sets out rules for the exercise of delegation and implementing powers. The proposal\\nempowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, implementing acts to ensure uniform\\napplication of the regulation or delegated acts to update or complement the lists in Annexes I\\nto VII.\\nTitle XII contains an obligation for the Commission to assess regularly the need for an update\\nof Annex III and to prepare regular reports on the evaluation and review of the regulation. It\\nalso lays down final provisions, including a differentiated transitional period for the initial\\ndate of the applicability of the regulation to facilitate the smooth implementation for all\\nparties concerned.\\x0cEN\\nProposal for a\\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\\nLAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\\n(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION\\nLEGISLATIVE ACTS\\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular\\nArticles 16 and 114 thereof,\\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee31,\\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions32,\\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\\nWhereas:\\n(1) The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by\\nlaying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, marketing\\nand use of artificial intelligence in conformity with Union values. This Regulation\\npursues a number of overriding reasons of public interest, such as a high level of\\nprotection of health, safety and fundamental rights, and it ensures the free movement\\nof AI-based goods and services cross-border, thus preventing Member States from\\nimposing restrictions on the development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless\\nexplicitly authorised by this Regulation.\\n(2) Artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) can be easily deployed in multiple sectors\\nof the economy and society, including cross border, and circulate throughout the\\nUnion. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to\\nensure that artificial intelligence is safe and is developed and used in compliance with\\nfundamental rights obligations. Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of\\nthe internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use AI\\nsystems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should\\ntherefore be ensured, while divergences hampering the free circulation of AI systems\\nand related products and services within the internal market should be prevented, by\\nlaying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform\\nprotection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout\\nthe internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the\\nEuropean Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on\\nthe protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning\\n31 OJ C […], […], p. […].\\n32 OJ C […], […], p. […].\\x0cEN\\nrestrictions of the use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in\\npublicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base\\nthis Regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the\\nTFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is\\nappropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.\\n(3) Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that can contribute to a\\nwide array of economic and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries\\nand social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource\\nallocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and\\norganisations, the use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages\\nto companies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for\\nexample in healthcare, farming, education and training, infrastructure management,\\nenergy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy\\nefficiency, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.\\n(4) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application\\nand use, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause harm to public interests\\nand rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be material or\\nimmaterial.\\n(5) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is\\ntherefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in\\nthe internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public\\ninterests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, as\\nrecognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the\\nplacing on the market and putting into service of certain AI systems should be laid\\ndown, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those\\nsystems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. By\\nlaying down those rules, this Regulation supports the objective of the Union of being a\\nglobal leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial\\nintelligence, as stated by the European Council33, and it ensures the protection of\\nethical principles, as specifically requested by the European Parliament34.\\n(6) The notion of AI system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty, while\\nproviding the flexibility to accommodate future technological developments. The\\ndefinition should be based on the key functional characteristics of the software, in\\nparticular the ability, for a given set of human-defined objectives, to generate outputs\\nsuch as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions which influence the\\nenvironment with which the system interacts, be it in a physical or digital dimension.\\nAI systems can be designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and be used on\\na stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system\\nis physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the\\nproduct without being integrated therein (non-embedded). The definition of AI system\\nshould be complemented by a list of specific techniques and approaches used for its\\ndevelopment, which should be kept up-to–date in the light of market and technological\\n33 European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions,\\nEUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6.\\n34 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a\\nframework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies,\\n2020/2012(INL).\\x0cEN\\ndevelopments through the adoption of delegated acts by the Commission to amend that\\nlist.\\n(7) The notion of biometric data used in this Regulation is in line with and should be\\ninterpreted consistently with the notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4(14) of\\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council35, Article\\n3(18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council36\\nand Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the\\nCouncil37.\\n(8) The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should\\nbe defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural\\npersons at a distance through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the\\nbiometric data contained in a reference database, and without prior knowledge whether\\nthe targeted person will be present and can be identified, irrespectively of the\\nparticular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Considering their\\ndifferent characteristics and manners in which they are used, as well as the different\\nrisks involved, a distinction should be made between ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote\\nbiometric identification systems. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of\\nthe biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously,\\nnear-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there\\nshould be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’\\nuse of the AI systems in question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems\\ninvolve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a\\ncamera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in\\ncontrast, the biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and\\nidentification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as\\npictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private\\ndevices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the\\nnatural persons concerned.\\n(9) For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be\\nunderstood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to the public,\\nirrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly owned. Therefore,\\nthe notion does not cover places that are private in nature and normally not freely\\naccessible for third parties, including law enforcement authorities, unless those parties\\nhave been specifically invited or authorised, such as homes, private clubs, offices,\\nwarehouses and factories. Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not\\nphysical spaces. However, the mere fact that certain conditions for accessing a\\n35 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the\\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of\\nsuch data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016,\\np. 1).\\n36 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the\\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions,\\nbodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No\\n37 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the\\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for\\nthe purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the\\nexecution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council\\nFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA (Law Enforcement Directive) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89).\\x0cEN\\nparticular space may apply, such as admission tickets or age restrictions, does not\\nmean that the space is not publicly accessible within the meaning of this Regulation.\\nConsequently, in addition to public spaces such as streets, relevant parts of\\ngovernment buildings and most transport infrastructure, spaces such as cinemas,\\ntheatres, shops and shopping centres are normally also publicly accessible. Whether a\\ngiven space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by-\\ncase basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.\\n(10) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and\\nfreedoms of individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation\\nshould apply to providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective\\nof whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to users of\\nAI systems established within the Union.\\n(11) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this\\nRegulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor\\nused in the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union\\nthat contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation\\nto an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk and\\nwhose effects impact natural persons located in the Union. In those circumstances, the\\nAI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully\\ncollected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in\\nthe Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI\\nsystem being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent\\nthe circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural\\npersons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and users\\nof AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced\\nby those systems is used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing\\narrangements and special needs for cooperation with foreign partners with whom\\ninformation and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public\\nauthorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the\\nframework of international agreements concluded at national or European level for law\\nenforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its Member States. Such\\nagreements have been concluded bilaterally between Member States and third\\ncountries or between the European Union, Europol and other EU agencies and third\\ncountries and international organisations.\\n(12) This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies and agencies\\nwhen acting as a provider or user of an AI system. AI systems exclusively developed\\nor used for military purposes should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation\\nwhere that use falls under the exclusive remit of the Common Foreign and Security\\nPolicy regulated under Title V of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU). This\\nRegulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of\\nintermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European\\nParliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act].\\n(13) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as\\nregards health, safety and fundamental rights, common normative standards for all\\nhigh-risk AI systems should be established. Those standards should be consistent with\\nthe Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the Charter) and should be\\nnon-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments.\\x0cEN\\n(14) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems,\\na clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor\\nthe type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI\\nsystems can generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain artificial intelligence\\npractices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the\\nrelevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.\\n(15) Aside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that technology can also\\nbe misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and\\nsocial control practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and should be\\nprohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity,\\nfreedom, equality, democracy and the rule of law and Union fundamental rights,\\nincluding the right to non-discrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of\\nthe child.\\n(16) The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems intended\\nto distort human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to\\noccur, should be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components\\nindividuals cannot perceive or exploit vulnerabilities of children and people due to\\ntheir age, physical or mental incapacities. They do so with the intention to materially\\ndistort the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm\\nto that or another person. The intention may not be presumed if the distortion of\\nhuman behaviour results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of\\nthe control of the provider or the user. Research for legitimate purposes in relation to\\nsuch AI systems should not be stifled by the prohibition, if such research does not\\namount to use of the AI system in human-machine relations that exposes natural\\npersons to harm and such research is carried out in accordance with recognised ethical\\nstandards for scientific research.\\n(17) AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons for general purpose by public\\nauthorities or on their behalf may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of\\ncertain groups. They may violate the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the\\nvalues of equality and justice. Such AI systems evaluate or classify the trustworthiness\\nof natural persons based on their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known or\\npredicted personal or personality characteristics. The social score obtained from such\\nAI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or\\nwhole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which\\nthe data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is\\ndisproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. Such AI\\nsystems should be therefore prohibited.\\n(18) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural\\npersons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is considered\\nparticularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent\\nthat it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of\\nconstant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly\\nand other fundamental rights. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited\\nopportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems\\noperating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the\\npersons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.\\n(19) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be\\nprohibited, except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where\\x0cEN\\nthe use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of\\nwhich outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for potential victims of\\ncrime, including missing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of\\nnatural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation, identification or\\nprosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Council\\nFramework Decision 2002/584/JHA38 if those criminal offences are punishable in the\\nMember State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum\\nperiod of at least three years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State.\\nSuch threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with\\nnational law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to\\npotentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.\\nMoreover, of the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision\\n2002/584/JHA, some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the\\nrecourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification will foreseeably be necessary\\nand proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the detection,\\nlocalisation, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of the different\\ncriminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness,\\nprobability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.\\n(20) In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate\\nmanner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those three exhaustively listed\\nand narrowly defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in\\nparticular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the\\nconsequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the\\nsafeguards and conditions provided for with the use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’\\nremote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose\\nof law enforcement should be subject to appropriate limits in time and space, having\\nregard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims or\\nperpetrator. The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case\\nin each of the three situations mentioned above.\\n(21) Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible\\nspaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific\\nauthorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a\\nMember State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use,\\nexcept in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use\\nthe systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to\\nobtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of urgency, the\\nuse should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to\\nappropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in\\nthe context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself.\\nIn addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations seek to obtain an\\nauthorisation as soon as possible, whilst providing the reasons for not having been able\\nto request it earlier.\\n(22) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this\\nRegulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this\\nRegulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in\\nquestion has decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its\\n38 Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the\\nsurrender procedures between Member States (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1).\\x0cEN\\ndetailed rules of national law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this\\nRegulation not to provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a\\npossibility in respect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use\\nidentified in this Regulation.\\n(23) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural\\npersons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily\\ninvolves the processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit,\\nsubject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should\\napply as lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data\\ncontained in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the\\nprocessing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use\\nand processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework\\nset by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the\\ncompetent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such\\nsystems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in Article 10\\nof Directive (EU) 2016/680. In this context, this Regulation is not intended to provide\\nthe legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive\\n2016/680. However, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in\\npublicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by\\ncompetent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such\\nuse for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes\\nother than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an\\nauthorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law\\nthat may give effect to it.\\n(24) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI\\nsystems for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of ‘real-time’\\nremote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose\\nof law enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, including where those systems are\\nused by competent authorities in publicly accessible spaces for other purposes than\\nlaw enforcement, should continue to comply with all requirements resulting from\\nArticle 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU)\\n2018/1725 and Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable.\\n(25) In accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United\\nKingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as\\nannexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in\\nArticle 5(1), point (d), (2) and (3) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 16\\nof the TFEU which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States\\nwhen carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title\\nV of Part Three of the TFEU, where Ireland is not bound by the rules governing the\\nforms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation which require\\ncompliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU.\\n(26) In accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark,\\nannexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark is not bound by rules laid down in Article\\n5(1), point (d), (2) and (3) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 16 of the\\nTFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the processing of personal data\\nby the Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter\\n4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU.\\x0cEN\\n(27) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market or put into service if\\nthey comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure\\nthat high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in\\nthe Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as\\nrecognised and protected by Union law. AI systems identified as high-risk should be\\nlimited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and\\nfundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any\\npotential restriction to international trade, if any.\\n(28) AI systems could produce adverse outcomes to health and safety of persons, in\\nparticular when such systems operate as components of products. Consistently with\\nthe objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of\\nproducts in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant\\nproducts find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be\\ngenerated by a product as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems,\\nare duly prevented and mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots,\\nwhether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able\\nto safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in\\nthe health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly\\nsophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be\\nreliable and accurate. The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the\\nfundamental rights protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying\\nan AI system as high-risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for\\nprivate and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and\\ninformation, freedom of assembly and of association, and non-discrimination,\\nconsumer protection, workers’ rights, rights of persons with disabilities, right to an\\neffective remedy and to a fair trial, right of defence and the presumption of innocence,\\nright to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight that\\nchildren have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and in the\\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the\\nUNCRC General Comment No. 25 as regards the digital environment), both of which\\nrequire consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection\\nand care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of\\nenvironmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies\\nshould also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system\\ncan cause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons.\\n(29) As regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or systems, or\\nwhich are themselves products or systems falling within the scope of Regulation (EC)\\nNo 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council39, Regulation (EU) No\\n167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council40, Regulation (EU) No\\n168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council41, Directive 2014/90/EU of\\n39 Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 on\\ncommon rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 (OJ L\\n97, 9.4.2008, p. 72).\\n40 Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February 2013 on the\\napproval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, p. 1).\\n41 Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the\\napproval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013,\\np. 52).\\x0cEN\\nthe European Parliament and of the Council42, Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the\\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council43, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European\\nParliament and of the Council44, Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European\\nParliament and of the Council45, and Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European\\nParliament and of the Council46, it is appropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the\\nCommission takes into account, on the basis of the technical and regulatory\\nspecificities of each sector, and without interfering with existing governance,\\nconformity assessment and enforcement mechanisms and authorities established\\ntherein, the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid down in this\\nRegulation when adopting any relevant future delegated or implementing acts on the\\nbasis of those acts.\\n(30) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are\\nthemselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation\\nlegislation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this Regulation if the\\nproduct in question undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party\\nconformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation legislation.\\nIn particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective\\nsystems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment,\\npressure equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances\\nburning gaseous fuels, medical devices, and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\\n(31) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not\\nnecessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI\\nsystem itself as a product, is considered ‘high-risk’ under the criteria established in the\\nrelevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is notably\\nthe case for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the\\n42 Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on marine\\nequipment and repealing Council Directive 96/98/EC (OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 146).\\n43 Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the\\ninteroperability of the rail system within the European Union (OJ L 138, 26.5.2016, p. 44).\\n44 Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the\\napproval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and\\nseparate technical units intended for such vehicles, amending Regulations (EC) No 715/2007 and (EC)\\nNo 595/2009 and repealing Directive 2007/46/EC (OJ L 151, 14.6.2018, p. 1).\\n45 Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common\\nrules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and\\namending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014\\nand Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and\\nrepealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\\nCouncil and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 (OJ L 212, 22.8.2018, p. 1).\\n46 Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on\\ntype-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate\\ntechnical units intended for such vehicles, as regards their general safety and the protection of vehicle\\noccupants and vulnerable road users, amending Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament\\nand of the Council and repealing Regulations (EC) No 78/2009, (EC) No 79/2009 and (EC) No\\n661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No\\n631/2009, (EU) No 406/2010, (EU) No 672/2010, (EU) No 1003/2010, (EU) No 1005/2010, (EU) No\\n1008/2010, (EU) No 1009/2010, (EU) No 19/2011, (EU) No 109/2011, (EU) No 458/2011, (EU) No\\n65/2012, (EU) No 130/2012, (EU) No 347/2012, (EU) No 351/2012, (EU) No 1230/2012 and (EU)\\n2015/166 (OJ L 325, 16.12.2019, p. 1).\\x0cEN\\nCouncil47 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the\\nCouncil48, where a third-party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and\\nhigh-risk products.\\n(32) As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that\\nare safety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate\\nto classify them as high-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high\\nrisk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into\\naccount both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and\\nthey are used in a number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation.\\nThe identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria\\nenvisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems.\\n(33) Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification\\nof natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is\\nparticularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, sex or disabilities. Therefore,\\n‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems should be classified as\\nhigh-risk. In view of the risks that they pose, both types of remote biometric\\nidentification systems should be subject to specific requirements on logging\\ncapabilities and human oversight.\\n(34) As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to\\nclassify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the\\nmanagement and operation of road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and\\nelectricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of\\npersons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of\\nsocial and economic activities.\\n(35) AI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or\\nassigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or to evaluate\\npersons on tests as part of or as a precondition for their education should be considered\\nhigh-risk, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a\\nperson’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When\\nimproperly designed and used, such systems may violate the right to education and\\ntraining as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical\\npatterns of discrimination.\\n(36) AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment,\\nnotably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions on\\npromotion and termination and for task allocation, monitoring or evaluation of persons\\nin work-related contractual relationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since\\nthose systems may appreciably impact future career prospects and livelihoods of these\\npersons. Relevant work-related contractual relationships should involve employees\\nand persons providing services through platforms as referred to in the Commission\\nWork Programme 2021. Such persons should in principle not be considered users\\nwithin the meaning of this Regulation. Throughout the recruitment process and in the\\n47 Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical\\ndevices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No\\n1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 1).\\n48 Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro\\ndiagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU\\n(OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 176).\\x0cEN\\nevaluation, promotion, or retention of persons in work-related contractual\\nrelationships, such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for\\nexample against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of\\ncertain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation. AI systems used to monitor the\\nperformance and behaviour of these persons may also impact their rights to data\\nprotection and privacy.\\n(37) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the\\naccess to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits\\nnecessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of\\nliving. In particular, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of\\nnatural persons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine\\nthose persons’ access to financial resources or essential services such as housing,\\nelectricity, and telecommunication services. AI systems used for this purpose may lead\\nto discrimination of persons or groups and perpetuate historical patterns of\\ndiscrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic origins, disabilities, age, sexual\\norientation, or create new forms of discriminatory impacts. Considering the very\\nlimited scale of the impact and the available alternatives on the market, it is\\nappropriate to exempt AI systems for the purpose of creditworthiness assessment and\\ncredit scoring when put into service by small-scale providers for their own use.\\nNatural persons applying for or receiving public assistance benefits and services from\\npublic authorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a\\nvulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for\\ndetermining whether such benefits and services should be denied, reduced, revoked or\\nreclaimed by authorities, they may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood\\nand may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non-\\ndiscrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy. Those systems should therefore\\nbe classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not hamper the\\ndevelopment and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which\\nwould stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided\\nthat those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons. Finally, AI\\nsystems used to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first\\nresponse services should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in\\nvery critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property.\\n(38) Actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are\\ncharacterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance,\\narrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on\\nfundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the AI system is not\\ntrained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its\\naccuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the\\nmarket or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or\\notherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important\\nprocedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair\\ntrial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be\\nhampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent,\\nexplainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk a\\nnumber of AI systems intended to be used in the law enforcement context where\\naccuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse\\nimpacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress. In view of\\nthe nature of the activities in question and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI\\nsystems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by law\\x0cEN\\nenforcement authorities for individual risk assessments, polygraphs and similar tools\\nor to detect the emotional state of natural person, to detect ‘deep fakes’, for the\\nevaluation of the reliability of evidence in criminal proceedings, for predicting the\\noccurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence based on\\nprofiling of natural persons, or assessing personality traits and characteristics or past\\ncriminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of\\ndetection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, as well as for crime\\nanalytics regarding natural persons. AI systems specifically intended to be used for\\nadministrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities should not be considered\\nhigh-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of\\nprevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.\\n(39) AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect people\\nwho are often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the\\noutcome of the actions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non-\\ndiscriminatory nature and transparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are\\ntherefore particularly important to guarantee the respect of the fundamental rights of\\nthe affected persons, notably their rights to free movement, non-discrimination,\\nprotection of private life and personal data, international protection and good\\nadministration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk AI systems intended\\nto be used by the competent public authorities charged with tasks in the fields of\\nmigration, asylum and border control management as polygraphs and similar tools or\\nto detect the emotional state of a natural person; for assessing certain risks posed by\\nnatural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying for visa or\\nasylum; for verifying the authenticity of the relevant documents of natural persons; for\\nassisting competent public authorities for the examination of applications for asylum,\\nvisa and residence permits and associated complaints with regard to the objective to\\nestablish the eligibility of the natural persons applying for a status. AI systems in the\\narea of migration, asylum and border control management covered by this Regulation\\nshould comply with the relevant procedural requirements set by the Directive\\n2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council49, the Regulation (EC) No\\n810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council50 and other relevant\\nlegislation.\\n(40) Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes\\nshould be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on\\ndemocracy, rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy\\nand to a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and\\nopacity, it is appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to assist judicial\\nauthorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to\\na concrete set of facts. Such qualification should not extend, however, to AI systems\\nintended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual\\nadministration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation or\\npseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between\\npersonnel, administrative tasks or allocation of resources.\\n49 Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common\\nprocedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, p. 60).\\n50 Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009\\nestablishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) (OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, p. 1).\\x0cEN\\n(41) The fact that an AI system is classified as high risk under this Regulation should not\\nbe interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is necessarily lawful under other\\nacts of Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the\\nprotection of personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems\\nto detect the emotional state of natural persons. Any such use should continue to occur\\nsolely in accordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and\\nfrom the applicable acts of secondary Union law and national law. This Regulation\\nshould not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal\\ndata, including special categories of personal data, where relevant.\\n(42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed or otherwise put into service on\\nthe Union market for users and affected persons, certain mandatory requirements\\nshould apply, taking into account the intended purpose of the use of the system and\\naccording to the risk management system to be established by the provider.\\n(43) Requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards the quality of data sets\\nused, technical documentation and record-keeping, transparency and the provision of\\ninformation to users, human oversight, and robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity.\\nThose requirements are necessary to effectively mitigate the risks for health, safety\\nand fundamental rights, as applicable in the light of the intended purpose of the\\nsystem, and no other less trade restrictive measures are reasonably available, thus\\navoiding unjustified restrictions to trade.\\n(44) High data quality is essential for the performance of many AI systems, especially\\nwhen techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that\\nthe high-risk AI system performs as intended and safely and it does not become the\\nsource of discrimination prohibited by Union law. High quality training, validation\\nand testing data sets require the implementation of appropriate data governance and\\nmanagement practices. Training, validation and testing data sets should be sufficiently\\nrelevant, representative and free of errors and complete in view of the intended\\npurpose of the system. They should also have the appropriate statistical properties,\\nincluding as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI\\nsystem is intended to be used. In particular, training, validation and testing data sets\\nshould take into account, to the extent required in the light of their intended purpose,\\nthe features, characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical,\\nbehavioural or functional setting or context within which the AI system is intended to\\nbe used. In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result\\nfrom the bias in AI systems, the providers shouldbe able to process also special\\ncategories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest, in order to ensure\\nthe bias monitoring, detection and correction in relation to high-risk AI systems.\\n(45) For the development of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as providers,\\nnotified bodies and other relevant entities, such as digital innovation hubs, testing\\nexperimentation facilities and researchers, should be able to access and use high\\nquality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this\\nRegulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the\\nfacilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public\\ninterest will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory\\naccess to high quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For\\nexample, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory\\naccess to health data and the training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those\\ndatasets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy manner,\\nand with an appropriate institutional governance. Relevant competent authorities,\\x0cEN\\nincluding sectoral ones, providing or supporting the access to data may also support\\nthe provision of high-quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems.\\n(46) Having information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how they\\nperform throughout their lifecycle is essential to verify compliance with the\\nrequirements under this Regulation. This requires keeping records and the availability\\nof a technical documentation, containing information which is necessary to assess the\\ncompliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements. Such information should\\ninclude the general characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system,\\nalgorithms, data, training, testing and validation processes used as well as\\ndocumentation on the relevant risk management system. The technical documentation\\nshould be kept up to date.\\n(47) To address the opacity that may make certain AI systems incomprehensible to or too\\ncomplex for natural persons, a certain degree of transparency should be required for\\nhigh-risk AI systems. Users should be able to interpret the system output and use it\\nappropriately. High-risk AI systems should therefore be accompanied by relevant\\ndocumentation and instructions of use and include concise and clear information,\\nincluding in relation to possible risks to fundamental rights and discrimination, where\\nappropriate.\\n(48) High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural\\npersons can oversee their functioning. For this purpose, appropriate human oversight\\nmeasures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the\\nmarket or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should\\nguarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be\\noverridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the\\nnatural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary\\ncompetence, training and authority to carry out that role.\\n(49) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet\\nan appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity in accordance with the\\ngenerally acknowledged state of the art. The level of accuracy and accuracy metrics\\nshould be communicated to the users.\\n(50) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should\\nbe resilient against risks connected to the limitations of the system (e.g. errors, faults,\\ninconsistencies, unexpected situations) as well as against malicious actions that may\\ncompromise the security of the AI system and result in harmful or otherwise\\nundesirable behaviour. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety\\nimpacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous\\ndecisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.\\n(51) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against\\nattempts to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security\\nproperties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities.\\nCyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data\\nsets (e.g. data poisoning) or trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks), or exploit\\nvulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure.\\nTo ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures should\\ntherefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as\\nappropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.\\x0cEN\\n(52) As part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the placing on the\\nmarket, putting into service and use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down\\nconsistently with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the\\nCouncil51 setting out the requirements for accreditation and the market surveillance of\\nproducts, Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council52\\non a common framework for the marketing of products and Regulation (EU)\\n2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council53 on market surveillance\\nand compliance of products (‘New Legislative Framework for the marketing of\\nproducts’).\\n(53) It is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the provider, takes\\nthe responsibility for the placing on the market or putting into service of a high-risk AI\\nsystem, regardless of whether that natural or legal person is the person who designed\\nor developed the system.\\n(54) The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the\\naccomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the\\nrelevant documentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring system. Public\\nauthorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own use may adopt\\nand implement the rules for the quality management system as part of the quality\\nmanagement system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking into\\naccount the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the\\npublic authority in question.\\n(55) Where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which is covered\\nby a relevant New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation is not placed on the\\nmarket or put into service independently from the product, the manufacturer of the\\nfinal product as defined under the relevant New Legislative Framework legislation\\nshould comply with the obligations of the provider established in this Regulation and\\nnotably ensure that the AI system embedded in the final product complies with the\\nrequirements of this Regulation.\\n(56) To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level-playing field for\\noperators, and taking into account the different forms of making available of digital\\nproducts, it is important to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in\\nthe Union can provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance\\nof an AI system. Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union,\\nwhere an importer cannot be identified, providers established outside the Union shall,\\nby written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union.\\n(57) In line with New Legislative Framework principles, specific obligations for relevant\\neconomic operators, such as importers and distributors, should be set to ensure legal\\ncertainty and facilitate regulatory compliance by those relevant operators.\\n51 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out\\nthe requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and\\nrepealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30).\\n52 Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common\\nframework for the marketing of products, and repealing Council Decision 93/465/EEC (OJ L 218,\\n13.8.2008, p. 82).\\n53 Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market\\nsurveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No\\n765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011 (Text with EEA relevance) (OJ L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 1–44).\\x0cEN\\n(58) Given the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental rights possibly\\nassociated with their use, including as regard the need to ensure proper monitoring of\\nthe performance of an AI system in a real-life setting, it is appropriate to set specific\\nresponsibilities for users. Users should in particular use high-risk AI systems in\\naccordance with the instructions of use and certain other obligations should be\\nprovided for with regard to monitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with\\nregard to record-keeping, as appropriate.\\n(59) It is appropriate to envisage that the user of the AI system should be the natural or\\nlegal person, public authority, agency or other body under whose authority the AI\\nsystem is operated except where the use is made in the course of a personal non-\\nprofessional activity.\\n(60) In the light of the complexity of the artificial intelligence value chain, relevant third\\nparties, notably the ones involved in the sale and the supply of software, software tools\\nand components, pre-trained models and data, or providers of network services, should\\ncooperate, as appropriate, with providers and users to enable their compliance with the\\nobligations under this Regulation and with competent authorities established under this\\nRegulation.\\n(61) Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to\\nensure compliance with this Regulation. Compliance with harmonised standards as\\ndefined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the\\nCouncil54 should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the\\nrequirements of this Regulation. However, the Commission could adopt common\\ntechnical specifications in areas where no harmonised standards exist or where they\\nare insufficient.\\n(62) In order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems, those\\nsystems should be subject to a conformity assessment prior to their placing on the\\nmarket or putting into service.\\n(63) It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any\\npossible duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by\\nexisting Union harmonisation legislation following the New Legislative Framework\\napproach, the compliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation\\nshould be assessed as part of the conformity assessment already foreseen under that\\nlegislation. The applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not\\naffect the specific logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment\\nunder the relevant specific New Legislative Framework legislation. This approach is\\nfully reflected in the interplay between this Regulation and the [Machinery\\nRegulation]. While safety risks of AI systems ensuring safety functions in machinery\\nare addressed by the requirements of this Regulation, certain specific requirements in\\nthe [Machinery Regulation] will ensure the safe integration of the AI system into the\\noverall machinery, so as not to compromise the safety of the machinery as a whole.\\n54 Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on\\nEuropean standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives\\n2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision\\n87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 316,\\n14.11.2012, p. 12).\\x0cEN\\nThe [Machinery Regulation] applies the same definition of AI system as this\\nRegulation.\\n(64) Given the more extensive experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field\\nof product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at\\nleast in an initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of\\nthird-party conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to\\nproducts. Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out\\nas a general rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception\\nof AI systems intended to be used for the remote biometric identification of persons,\\nfor which the involvement of a notified body in the conformity assessment should be\\nforeseen, to the extent they are not prohibited.\\n(65) In order to carry out third-party conformity assessment for AI systems intended to be\\nused for the remote biometric identification of persons, notified bodies should be\\ndesignated under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided they\\nare compliant with a set of requirements, notably on independence, competence and\\nabsence of conflicts of interests.\\n(66) In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products\\nregulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that an AI system\\nundergoes a new conformity assessment whenever a change occurs which may affect\\nthe compliance of the system with this Regulation or when the intended purpose of the\\nsystem changes. In addition, as regards AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after\\nbeing placed on the market or put into service (i.e. they automatically adapt how\\nfunctions are carried out), it is necessary to provide rules establishing that changes to\\nthe algorithm and its performance that have been pre-determined by the provider and\\nassessed at the moment of the conformity assessment should not constitute a\\nsubstantial modification.\\n(67) High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with\\nthis Regulation so that they can move freely within the internal market. Member States\\nshould not create unjustified obstacles to the placing on the market or putting into\\nservice of high-risk AI systems that comply with the requirements laid down in this\\nRegulation and bear the CE marking.\\n(68) Under certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial\\nfor health and safety of persons and for society as a whole. It is thus appropriate that\\nunder exceptional reasons of public security or protection of life and health of natural\\npersons and the protection of industrial and commercial property, Member States\\ncould authorise the placing on the market or putting into service of AI systems which\\nhave not undergone a conformity assessment.\\n(69) In order to facilitate the work of the Commission and the Member States in the\\nartificial intelligence field as well as to increase the transparency towards the public,\\nproviders of high-risk AI systems other than those related to products falling within\\nthe scope of relevant existing Union harmonisation legislation, should be required to\\nregister their high-risk AI system in a EU database, to be established and managed by\\nthe Commission. The Commission should be the controller of that database, in\\naccordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the\\x0cEN\\nCouncil55. In order to ensure the full functionality of the database, when deployed, the\\nprocedure for setting the database should include the elaboration of functional\\nspecifications by the Commission and an independent audit report.\\n(70) Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content\\nmay pose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they\\nqualify as high-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should\\ntherefore be subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the\\nrequirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems. In particular, natural persons\\nshould be notified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious\\nfrom the circumstances and the context of use. Moreover, natural persons should be\\nnotified when they are exposed to an emotion recognition system or a biometric\\ncategorisation system. Such information and notifications should be provided in\\naccessible formats for persons with disabilities. Further, users, who use an AI system\\nto generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles\\nexisting persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic,\\nshould disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by\\nlabelling the artificial intelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial\\norigin.\\n(71) Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires\\nnovel forms of regulatory oversight and a safe space for experimentation, while\\nensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk\\nmitigation measures. To ensure a legal framework that is innovation-friendly, future-\\nproof and resilient to disruption, national competent authorities from one or more\\nMember States should be encouraged to establish artificial intelligence regulatory\\nsandboxes to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under\\nstrict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise\\nput into service.\\n(72) The objectives of the regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by\\nestablishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development\\nand pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI\\nsystems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and Member States legislation;\\nto enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and\\nunderstanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, and to\\naccelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for small and medium\\nenterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union\\nand economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory\\nsandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant\\nauthorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. This Regulation should\\nprovide the legal basis for the use of personal data collected for other purposes for\\ndeveloping certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox,\\nin line with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and Article 6 of Regulation\\n(EU) 2018/1725, and without prejudice to Article 4(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/680.\\nParticipants in the sandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with\\nthe competent authorities, including by following their guidance and acting\\n55 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the\\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of\\nsuch data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016,\\np. 1).\\x0cEN\\nexpeditiously and in good faith to mitigate any high-risks to safety and fundamental\\nrights that may arise during the development and experimentation in the sandbox. The\\nconduct of the participants in the sandbox should be taken into account when\\ncompetent authorities decide whether to impose an administrative fine under Article\\n83(2) of Regulation 2016/679 and Article 57 of Directive 2016/680.\\n(73) In order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of small-\\nscale providers and users of AI systems are taken into particular account. To this\\nobjective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at those\\noperators, including on awareness raising and information communication. Moreover,\\nthe specific interests and needs of small-scale providers shall be taken into account\\nwhen Notified Bodies set conformity assessment fees. Translation costs related to\\nmandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a\\nsignificant cost for providers and other operators, notably those of a smaller scale.\\nMember States should possibly ensure that one of the languages determined and\\naccepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication with\\noperators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross-\\nborder users.\\n(74) In order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of knowledge and\\nexpertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers and notified\\nbodies with their obligations under this Regulation, the AI-on demand platform, the\\nEuropean Digital Innovation Hubs and the Testing and Experimentation Facilities\\nestablished by the Commission and the Member States at national or EU level should\\npossibly contribute to the implementation of this Regulation. Within their respective\\nmission and fields of competence, they may provide in particular technical and\\nscientific support to providers and notified bodies.\\n(75) It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to\\nTesting and Experimentation Facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or\\naccredited pursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil\\ntasks in the context of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that\\nUnion harmonisation legislation. This is notably the case for expert panels, expert\\nlaboratories and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to\\nRegulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746.\\n(76) In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this\\nRegulation a European Artificial Intelligence Board should be established. The Board\\nshould be responsible for a number of advisory tasks, including issuing opinions,\\nrecommendations, advice or guidance on matters related to the implementation of this\\nRegulation, including on technical specifications or existing standards regarding the\\nrequirements established in this Regulation and providing advice to and assisting the\\nCommission on specific questions related to artificial intelligence.\\n(77) Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation.\\nIn this respect, each Member State should designate one or more national competent\\nauthorities for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of this\\nRegulation. In order to increase organisation efficiency on the side of Member States\\nand to set an official point of contact vis-à-vis the public and other counterparts at\\nMember State and Union levels, in each Member State one national authority should\\nbe designated as national supervisory authority.\\n(78) In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the\\nexperience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the\\x0cEN\\ndesign and development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely\\nmanner, all providers should have a post-market monitoring system in place. This\\nsystem is also key to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which\\ncontinue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service can be more\\nefficiently and timely addressed. In this context, providers should also be required to\\nhave a system in place to report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents or any\\nbreaches to national and Union law protecting fundamental rights resulting from the\\nuse of their AI systems.\\n(79) In order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and\\nobligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union harmonisation legislation, the\\nsystem of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation\\n(EU) 2019/1020 should apply in its entirety. Where necessary for their mandate,\\nnational public authorities or bodies, which supervise the application of Union law\\nprotecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies, should also have access to\\nany documentation created under this Regulation.\\n(80) Union legislation on financial services includes internal governance and risk\\nmanagement rules and requirements which are applicable to regulated financial\\ninstitutions in the course of provision of those services, including when they make use\\nof AI systems. In order to ensure coherent application and enforcement of the\\nobligations under this Regulation and relevant rules and requirements of the Union\\nfinancial services legislation, the authorities responsible for the supervision and\\nenforcement of the financial services legislation, including where applicable the\\nEuropean Central Bank, should be designated as competent authorities for the purpose\\nof supervising the implementation of this Regulation, including for market\\nsurveillance activities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and\\nsupervised financial institutions. To further enhance the consistency between this\\nRegulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated under Directive\\n2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council56, it is also appropriate to\\nintegrate the conformity assessment procedure and some of the providers’ procedural\\nobligations in relation to risk management, post marketing monitoring and\\ndocumentation into the existing obligations and procedures under Directive\\n2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be envisaged\\nin relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring\\nobligation placed on users of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to\\ncredit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU.\\n(81) The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with\\nthe requirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of trustworthy artificial\\nintelligence in the Union. Providers of non-high-risk AI systems should be encouraged\\nto create codes of conduct intended to foster the voluntary application of the\\nmandatory requirements applicable to high-risk AI systems. Providers should also be\\nencouraged to apply on a voluntary basis additional requirements related, for example,\\nto environmental sustainability, accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders’\\nparticipation in the design and development of AI systems, and diversity of the\\ndevelopment teams. The Commission may develop initiatives, including of a sectorial\\n56 Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the\\nactivity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms,\\namending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176,\\n27.6.2013, p. 338).\\x0cEN\\nnature, to facilitate the lowering of technical barriers hindering cross-border exchange\\nof data for AI development, including on data access infrastructure, semantic and\\ntechnical interoperability of different types of data.\\n(82) It is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk in accordance\\nwith this Regulation and thus are not required to comply with the requirements set out\\nherein are nevertheless safe when placed on the market or put into service. To\\ncontribute to this objective, the Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and\\nof the Council57 would apply as a safety net.\\n(83) In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities on\\nUnion and national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation\\nshould respect the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out\\ntheir tasks.\\n(84) Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of this\\nRegulation are implemented, including by laying down effective, proportionate and\\ndissuasive penalties for their infringement. For certain specific infringements, Member\\nStates should take into account the margins and criteria set out in this Regulation. The\\nEuropean Data Protection Supervisor should have the power to impose fines on Union\\ninstitutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation.\\n(85) In order to ensure that the regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the\\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the\\nCommission to amend the techniques and approaches referred to in Annex I to define\\nAI systems, the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, the high-risk AI\\nsystems listed in Annex III, the provisions regarding technical documentation listed in\\nAnnex IV, the content of the EU declaration of conformity in Annex V, the provisions\\nregarding the conformity assessment procedures in Annex VI and VII and the\\nprovisions establishing the high-risk AI systems to which the conformity assessment\\nprocedure based on assessment of the quality management system and assessment of\\nthe technical documentation should apply. It is of particular importance that the\\nCommission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including\\nat expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the\\nprinciples laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better\\nLaw-Making58. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of\\ndelegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the\\nsame time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to\\nmeetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\\n(86) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation,\\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should\\nbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European\\nParliament and of the Council59.\\n(87) Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\\nStates and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved\\n57 Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general\\nproduct safety (OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, p. 4).\\n58 OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.\\n59 Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011\\nlaying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States\\nof the Commission\\'s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p.13).\\x0cEN\\nat Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of\\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of\\nproportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is\\nnecessary in order to achieve that objective.\\n(88) This Regulation should apply from … [OP – please insert the date established in Art.\\n85]. However, the infrastructure related to the governance and the conformity\\nassessment system should be operational before that date, therefore the provisions on\\nnotified bodies and governance structure should apply from … [OP – please insert the\\ndate – three months following the entry into force of this Regulation]. In addition,\\nMember States should lay down and notify to the Commission the rules on penalties,\\nincluding administrative fines, and ensure that they are properly and effectively\\nimplemented by the date of application of this Regulation. Therefore the provisions on\\npenalties should apply from [OP – please insert the date – twelve months following the\\nentry into force of this Regulation].\\n(89) The European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board\\nwere consulted in accordance with Article 42(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and\\ndelivered an opinion on […]”.\\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\\nTITLE I\\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\\nSubject matter\\nThis Regulation lays down:\\n(a) harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the\\nuse of artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) in the Union;\\n(a) prohibitions of certain artificial intelligence practices;\\n(b) specific requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for operators of\\nsuch systems;\\n(c) harmonised transparency rules for AI systems intended to interact with natural\\npersons, emotion recognition systems and biometric categorisation systems,\\nand AI systems used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content;\\n(d) rules on market monitoring and surveillance.\\nScope\\n1.

Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g.\\ncoordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For\\nthe purposes of this point \\'added value of Union involvement\\' is the value resulting\\nfrom Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been\\notherwise created by Member States alone.\\nAn emerging patchy framework of potentially divergent national rules will hamper\\nthe seamless provision of AI systems across the EU and is ineffective in ensuring the\\x0cEN\\nsafety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values across the different\\nMember States. A common EU legislative action on AI could boost the internal\\nmarket and has great potential to provide European industry with a competitive edge\\nat the global scene and economies of scale that cannot be achieved by individual\\nMember States alone.\\n1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\\nThe E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides the core framework for the\\nfunctioning of the single market and the supervision of digital services and sets a\\nbasic structure for a general cooperation mechanism among Member States, covering\\nin principle all requirements applicable to digital services. The evaluation of the\\nDirective pointed to shortcomings in several aspects of this cooperation mechanism,\\nincluding important procedural aspects such as the lack of clear timeframes for\\nresponse from Member States coupled with a general lack of responsiveness to\\nrequests from their counterparts. This has led over the years to a lack of trust\\nbetween Member States in addressing concerns about providers offering digital\\nservices cross-border. The evaluation of the Directive showed the need to define a\\ndifferentiated set of rules and requirements at European level. For this reason, the\\nimplementation of the specific obligations laid down in this Regulation would\\nrequire a specific cooperation mechanism at EU level, with a governance structure\\nensuring coordination of specific responsible bodies at EU level.\\n1.5.4. Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies\\nwith other appropriate instruments\\nThe Regulation Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence and\\nAmending Certain Union Legislative Acts defines a new common framework of\\nrequirements applicable to AI systems, which goes well beyond the framework\\nprovided by existing legislation. For this reason, a new national and European\\nregulatory and coordination function needs to be established with this proposal.\\nAs regards possible synergies with other appropriate instruments, the role of\\nnotifying authorities at national level can be performed by national authorities\\nfulfilling similar functions sunder other EU regulations.\\nMoreover, by increasing trust in AI and thus encouraging investment in development\\nand adoption of AI, it complements Digital Europe, for which promoting the\\ndiffusion of AI is one of five priorities.\\n1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for\\nredeployment\\nThe staff will be redeployed. The other costs will be supported from the DEP.\\nenvelope, given that the objective of this regulation – ensuring trustworthy AI –\\ncontributes directly to one key objective of Digital Europe – accelerating AI\\ndevelopment and deployment in Europe.\\x0cEN\\n1.6.

MANAGEMENT MEASURES\\n2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules\\nSpecify frequency and conditions.\\nThe Regulation will be reviewed and evaluated five years from the entry into force of\\nthe regulation. The Commission will report on the findings of the evaluation to the\\nEuropean Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social\\nCommittee.\\n2.2. Management and control system(s)\\n2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s),\\nthe payment modalities and the control strategy proposed\\nThe Regulation establishes a new policy with regard to harmonised rules for the\\nprovision of artificial intelligence systems in the internal market while ensuring the\\nrespect of safety and fundamental rights. These new rules require a consistency\\nmechanism for the cross-border application of the obligations under this Regulation\\nin the form of a new advisory group coordinating the activities of national\\nauthorities.\\nIn order to face these new tasks, it is necessary to appropriately resource the\\nCommission’s services. The enforcement of the new Regulation is estimated to\\nrequire 10 FTE à regime (5 FTE for the support to the activities of the Board and 5\\nFTE for the European Data Protection Supervisor acting as a notifying body for AI\\nsystems deployed by a body of the European Union).\\n2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up\\nto mitigate them\\nIn order to ensure that the members of the Board have the possibility to make\\ninformed analysis on the basis of factual evidence, it is foreseen that the Board\\nshould be supported by the administrative structure of the Commission and that an\\nexpert group be created to provide additional expertise where required.\\n2.2.3. Estimate and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control\\ncosts ÷ value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels\\nof risk of error (at payment & at closure)\\nFor the meeting expenditure, given the low value per transaction (e.g. refunding\\ntravel costs for a delegate for a meeting), standard control procedures seem\\nsufficient. Regarding the development of the database, contract attribution has a\\nstrong internal control system in place in DG CNECT through centralised\\nprocurement activities.\\n2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities\\nSpecify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.\\nThe existing fraud prevention measures applicable to the Commission will cover the\\nadditional appropriations necessary for this Regulation.\\x0cEN\\n3.

Legal basis\\nThe legal basis for the proposal is in the first place Article 114 of the Treaty on the\\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the adoption of measures to\\nensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\\nThis proposal constitutes a core part of the EU digital single market strategy. The primary\\nobjective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by setting\\nharmonised rules in particular on the development, placing on the Union market and the use\\nof products and services making use of AI technologies or provided as stand-alone AI\\nsystems. Some Member States are already considering national rules to ensure that AI is safe\\nand is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. ',\n",
       " 'This will likely\\nlead to two main problems: i) a fragmentation of the internal market on essential elements\\nregarding in particular the requirements for the AI products and services, their marketing,\\ntheir use, the liability and the supervision by public authorities, and ii) the substantial\\ndiminishment of legal certainty for both providers and users of AI systems on how existing\\nand new rules will apply to those systems in the Union. Given the wide circulation of products\\nand services across borders, these two problems can be best solved through EU harmonizing\\nlegislation.\\nIndeed, the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and\\ndevelopment of certain AI systems before they are placed on the market that will be further\\noperationalised through harmonised technical standards. The proposal also addresses the\\nsituation after AI systems have been placed on the market by harmonising the way in which\\nex-post controls are conducted.\\n',\n",
       " 'In addition, considering that this proposal contains certain specific rules on the protection of\\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data, notably restrictions of the use of AI\\nsystems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the\\npurpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this regulation, in as far as those specific\\nrules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU.\\n2.2. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\\nThe nature of AI, which often relies on large and varied datasets and which may be embedded\\nin any product or service circulating freely within the internal market, entails that the\\nobjectives of this proposal cannot be effectively achieved by Member States alone.\\n',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, an emerging patchwork of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the\\nseamless circulation of products and services related to AI systems across the EU and will be\\nineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values\\nacross the different Member States. National approaches in addressing the problems will only\\ncreate additional legal uncertainty and barriers, and will slow market uptake of AI.\\nThe objectives of this proposal can be better achieved at Union level to avoid a further\\nfragmentation of the Single Market into potentially contradictory national frameworks\\npreventing the free circulation of goods and services embedding AI. A solid European\\nregulatory framework for trustworthy AI will also ensure a level playing field and protect all\\npeople, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI.

       " 'Only\\ncommon action at Union level can also protect the Union’s digital sovereignty and leverage\\nits tools and regulatory powers to shape global rules and standards.\\x0cEN\\nThe proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and necessary to\\nachieve its objectives, since it follows a risk-based approach and imposes regulatory burdens\\nonly when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety. For\\nother, non-high-risk AI systems, only very limited transparency obligations are imposed, for\\nexample in terms of the provision of information to flag the use of an AI system when\\ninteracting with humans. For high-risk AI systems, the requirements of high quality data,\\ndocumentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness, are\\nstrictly necessary to mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and safety posed by AI and that\\nare not covered by other existing legal frameworks.

The costs incurred by\\noperators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the economic and reputational\\nbenefits that operators can expect from this proposal.\\n2.4. Choice of the instrument\\nThe choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform\\napplication of the new rules, such as definition of AI, the prohibition of certain harmful AI-\\nenabled practices and the classification of certain AI systems. The direct applicability of a\\nRegulation, in accordance with Article 288 TFEU, will reduce legal fragmentation and\\nfacilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI systems.

SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS (TITLE I)\\nTitle I defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of application of the new\\nrules that cover the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems.

HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS (TITLE III)\\nTitle III contains specific rules for AI systems that create a high risk to the health and safety\\nor fundamental rights of natural persons. In line with a risk-based approach, those high-risk\\nAI systems are permitted on the European market subject to compliance with certain\\nmandatory requirements and an ex-ante conformity assessment. The classification of an AI\\nsystem as high-risk is based on the intended purpose of the AI system, in line with existing\\nproduct safety legislation. Therefore, the classification as high-risk does not only depend on\\nthe function performed by the AI system, but also on the specific purpose and modalities for\\nwhich that system is used.\\n',\n",

The key difference is that the ex-ante and ex-post mechanisms\\nwill ensure compliance not only with the requirements established by sectorial legislation, but\\nalso with the requirements established by this regulation.\\nAs regards stand-alone high-risk AI systems that are referred to in Annex III, a new\\ncompliance and enforcement system will be established. ',\n",
       " 'This follows the model of the New\\nLegislative Framework legislation implemented through internal control checks by the\\nproviders with the exception of remote biometric identification systems that would be subject\\nto third party conformity assessment. A comprehensive ex-ante conformity assessment\\nthrough internal checks, combined with a strong ex-post enforcement, could be an effective\\nand reasonable solution for those systems, given the early phase of the regulatory intervention\\nand the fact the AI sector is very innovative and expertise for auditing is only now being\\naccumulated. An assessment through internal checks for ‘stand-alone’ high-risk AI systems\\nwould require a full, effective and properly documented ex ante compliance with all\\nrequirements of the regulation and compliance with robust quality and risk management\\nsystems and post-market monitoring.

Transparency obligations will apply for systems that (i) interact with humans, (ii) are\\nused to detect emotions or determine association with (social) categories based on biometric\\ndata, or (iii) generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes’). When persons interact with an AI\\nsystem or their emotions or characteristics are recognised through automated means, people\\nmust be informed of that circumstance. If an AI system is used to generate or manipulate\\nimage, audio or video content that appreciably resembles authentic content, there should be an\\nobligation to disclose that the content is generated through automated means, subject to\\x0cEN\\nexceptions for legitimate purposes (law enforcement, freedom of expression).
