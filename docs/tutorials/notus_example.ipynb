    "[distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel) is an AI Feedback (AIF) framework that can generate and label datasets using LLMs, and can be used for many different use cases. Implemented with robustness, efficiency and scalability in mind, it allows anyone to build their own synthetic datasets that can be used in many different scenarios. This tutorials shows and end-to-end example in which we will create a model expert in the new AI Act, to which we can make different types of questions and requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM model that we will fine-tune for this is [Notus 7B](https://argilla.io/blog/notus7b/), a fine-tuned version of Zephyr 7B that uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and AIF techniques to outperfom its foundation model in several benchmarks, and is completely open-source. "

    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces:** If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb).

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\\n1.1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\\nThis explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down\\nharmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence\\n(AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and\\nsocietal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving\\nprediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery,\\nthe use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes\\nand provide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. ',\n",
       " 'Such\\naction is especially needed in high-impact sectors, including climate change, environment and\\nhealth, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, the same\\nelements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also bring about\\nnew risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society. In light of the speed of\\ntechnological change and possible challenges, the EU is committed to strive for a balanced\\napproach. It is in the Union interest to preserve the EU’s technological leadership and to\\nensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed and functioning\\naccording to Union values, fundamental rights and principles.\\n',\n",
       " 'This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who\\nannounced in her political guidelines for the 2019-2024 Commission “A Union that strives for\\nmore”1, that the Commission would put forward legislation for a coordinated European\\napproach on the human and ethical implications of AI. Following on that announcement, on\\n19 February 2020 the Commission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach\\nto excellence and trust2. The White Paper sets out policy options on how to achieve the twin\\nobjective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain\\nuses of such technology. This proposal aims to implement the second objective for the\\ndevelopment of an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for trustworthy AI. ',\n",
       " 'The\\nproposal is based on EU values and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other\\nusers the confidence to embrace AI-based solutions, while encouraging businesses to develop\\nthem. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in society with the ultimate aim\\nof increasing human well-being. Rules for AI available in the Union market or otherwise\\naffecting people in the Union should therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that\\nthe technology is used in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including the respect\\nof fundamental rights. Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission\\nlaunched a broad stakeholder consultation, which was met with a great interest by a large\\nnumber of stakeholders who were largely supportive of regulatory intervention to address the\\nchallenges and concerns raised by the increasing use of AI.\\n',\n",
       " 'The proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament (EP) and the\\nEuropean Council, which have repeatedly expressed calls for legislative action to ensure a\\nwell-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both\\nbenefits and risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level. It supports the objective of\\nthe Union being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial\\n2 European Commission, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and\\ntrust, COM(2020) 65 final, 2020.\\x0cEN\\nintelligence as stated by the European Council3 and ensures the protection of ethical principles\\nas specifically requested by the European Parliament4.\\nIn 2017, the European Council called for a ‘sense of urgency to address emerging trends’\\nincluding ‘issues such as artificial intelligence …, while at the same time ensuring a high\\nlevel of data protection, digital rights and ethical standards’5.

Here are some ways AI can achieve these benefits:\\n\\n1. Prediction: AI can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, trends, and correlations that are difficult for humans to detect. This ability can help organizations make accurate predictions about future events, such as demand forecasting, weather forecasting, and stock market trends. AI can also predict equipment failures, enabling maintenance teams to schedule repairs before breakdowns occur.\\n\\n2. Optimization: AI can optimize operations by analyzing data and identifying the most efficient and cost-effective ways to perform tasks. This includes optimizing supply chain management, logistics, and transportation routes, reducing waste, and minimizing energy consumption. AI can also optimize pricing strategies, inventory management, and staffing levels.\\n\\n3. Resource allocation: AI can help organizations allocate resources effectively by analyzing data and identifying the most critical areas of need. This includes allocating resources to high-priority projects, identifying underutilized resources, and optimizing workforce distribution.

Here are some ways AI can achieve these benefits:\\n\\n1. Improved Prediction:\\nAI can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, trends, and correlations that are not visible to humans. This ability to analyze data and make predictions can help organizations make informed decisions, reduce risks, and increase efficiency. For example, AI-powered weather forecasting can help farmers plan their crop cycles, while AI-powered traffic prediction can help transportation companies optimize their routes.\\n\\n2. Optimized Operations:\\nAI can optimize operations by automating repetitive tasks, reducing errors, and increasing efficiency. This can lead to cost savings, increased productivity, and improved quality. For example, AI-powered inventory management can help retailers optimize their stock levels, while AI-powered supply chain optimization can help manufacturers reduce waste and improve delivery times.\\n\\n3. Personalized Service Delivery:\\nAI can analyze user data and preferences to provide personalized recommendations, offers, and experiences. This can increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue. For example, AI-powered chatbots can provide personal\\n\\n### Output \",\n",
