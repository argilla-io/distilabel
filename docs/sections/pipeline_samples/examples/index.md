# Pipeline Samples

- **Tutorials** provide detailed step-by-step explanations and the code used for end-to-end workflows.
- **Paper implementations** provide reproductions of fundamental papers in the synthetic data domain.
- **Examples** don't provide explenations but simply show code for different tasks.
