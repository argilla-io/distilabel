# Create Function-Calling datasets with APIGen

This example will introduce [APIGen: Automated Pipeline for Generating Verifiable and Diverse Function-Calling Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18518), a data generation pipeline designed to synthesize verifiable high-quality datasets for function-calling applications.

## Replication

The following figure showcases the APIGen framework:

Now, let's walk through the key steps illustrated in the figure:

- [`DataSampler`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/step/datasampler/): With the help of this step and the original [Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k) we are getting the Seed QA Data Sampler for the prompt template.

- [`APIGenGenerator`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/task/apigengenerator/): This step does the job of the *Query-Answer Generator*, including the format checker from *Stage 1: Format Checker* thanks to the structured output generation.

- [`APIGenExecutionChecker`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/task/apigenexecutionchecker/): This step is in charge of the *Stage 2: Execution Checker*.

- [`APIGenSemanticChecker`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/task/apigensemanticchecker/): Step in charge of running *Stage 3: Semantic Checker*, can use the same or a different LLM, we are using the same as in [`APIGenGenerator`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/task/apigengenerator/) step.

The current implementation hasn't utilized the *Diverse Prompt Library*. To incorporate it, one could either adjust the prompt template within the [`APIGenGenerator`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/task/apigengenerator/) or develop a new sampler specifically for this purpose. As for the *API Sampler*, while no specific data is shared here, we've created illustrative examples to demonstrate the pipeline's functionality. These examples represent a mix of data that could be used to replicate the sampler's output.

## Data preparation

The original paper tells about the data they used and give some hints, but nothing was shared. In this example, we will write a bunch of examples by hand to showcase how this pipeline can be built.

Assume we have the following function names, and corresponding descriptions of their behaviour:

```python
data = [
    {
        "func_name": "final_velocity",
        "func_desc": "Calculates the final velocity of an object given its initial velocity, acceleration, and time.",
    },
    {
        "func_name": "permutation_count",
        "func_desc": "Calculates the number of permutations of k elements from a set of n elements.",
    },
    {
        "func_name": "getdivision",
        "func_desc": "Divides two numbers by making an API call to a division service.",
    },
    {
        "func_name": "binary_addition",
        "func_desc": "Adds two binary numbers and returns the result as a binary string.",
    },
    {
        "func_name": "swapi_planet_resource",
        "func_desc": "get a specific planets resource",
    },
    {
        "func_name": "disney_character",
        "func_desc": "Find a specific character using this endpoint",
    }
]
```

The original paper refers to both python functions and APIs, but we will make use of python functions exclusively for simplicity. In order to execute and check this functions/APIs, we need access to the code, which we have moved to a Python file: [lib_apigen.py](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel/blob/main/examples/lib_apigen.py). All this functions are executable, but we also need access to their *tool* representation. For this, we will make use of transformers' *get_json_schema* function[^1].

[^1]: Read this nice blog post for more information on tools and the reasoning behind `get_json_schema`: [Tool Use, Unified](https://huggingface.co/blog/unified-tool-use).

We have all the machinery prepared in our libpath, except from the *tool* definition. With the help of our helper function `load_module_from_path` we will load this python module, collect all the tools, and add them to each row in our `data` variable.

```python
from distilabel.steps.tasks.apigen.utils import load_module_from_path

libpath_module = load_module_from_path(libpath)
tools = getattr(libpath_module, "get_tools")()  # call get_tools()

for row in data:
    #Â The tools should have a mix where both the correct and irrelevant tools are present.
    row.update({"tools": [tools[row["func_name"]]]})
```

Now we have all the necessary data for our prompt. Additionally, we will make use of the original dataset as few-shot examples to enhance the model:

```python
ds_og = (
    load_dataset("Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k", split="train")
    .shuffle(seed=42)
    .select(range(500))
    .to_list()
)
```

We have just loaded a subset and transformed it to a list of dictionaries, as we will use it in the [`DataSampler`](https://distilabel.argilla.io/dev/components-gallery/steps/datasampler/) `GeneratorStep`, grabbing random examples from the original dataset.

## Building the Pipeline

Now that we've walked through each component, it's time to see how it all comes together, here's the Pipeline code:

```python
with Pipeline(name="apigen-example") as pipeline:
    loader_seeds = LoadDataFromDicts(data=data)  # (1)

    sampler = DataSampler(  # (2)
        data=ds_og,
        size=2,
        samples=len(data),
        batch_size=8,
    )

    prep_examples = PrepareExamples()  # This step will add the 'examples' column

    combine_steps = CombineOutputs()  # (3)

    model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"
    llm=InferenceEndpointsLLM(  # (4)
        model_id=model_id,
        tokenizer_id=model_id,
        generation_kwargs={
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "max_new_tokens": 2048,
        },
    )
    apigen = APIGenGenerator(  # (5)
        llm=llm,
        use_default_structured_output=True,
    )

    execution_checker = APIGenExecutionChecker(libpath=str(libpath))  # (6)
    semantic_checker = APIGenSemanticChecker(llm=llm)  # (7)

    sampler >> prep_examples
    (
        [loader_seeds, prep_examples] 
        >> combine_steps 
        >> apigen
        >> execution_checker
        >> semantic_checker
    )
```

1. Load the data seeds we are going to use to generate our function calling dataset.

2. The `DataSampler` together with `PrepareExamples` will be used to help us create the few-shot
examples from the original dataset to be fed in our prompt.

3. Combine both columns to obtain a single stream of data

4. Will reuse the same LLM for the generation and the semantic checks.

5. Creates the `query` and `answers` that will be used together with the `tools` to fine-tune a new model. Will generate the structured outputs to ensure we have valid JSON formatted answers.

6. Adds columns `keep_row_after_execution_check` and `execution_result`.

7. Adds columns `keep_row_after_semantic_check` and `thought`.

## Script and final dataset

To see all the pieces in place, take a look at the full pipeline, as well as an example row that would be generated from this pipeline.

    ```python
    python examples/pipeline_apigen.py
    ```

```python title="pipeline_apigen.py"
--8<-- "examples/pipeline_apigen.py"
