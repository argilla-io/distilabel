# Distiset

A [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline] in `distilabel` returns a special type of Hugging Face [`datasets.DatasetDict`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.DatasetDict) which is called [`Distiset`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset], as a combination of `distilabel` and dataset. This object is a wrapper around [`datasets.Dataset`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset) which comes with some extra functionality to easily deal with the dataset pieces that a [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline] can generate.

The [`Distiset`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset] is a dictionary-like object that contains the different configurations generated by the [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline], where each configuration corresponds to each leaf step in the DAG built by the [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline]. Each configuration corresponds to a different subset of the dataset, which is a concept taken from ðŸ¤— `datasets` that lets you upload different configurations of the same dataset within the same repository and can contain different columns i.e. different configurations, which can be seamlessly pushed to the Hugging Face Hub straight away.

Below you can find an example on how to create a [`Distiset`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset] object, similarly as a [`datasets.DatasetDict`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.DatasetDict), which is not required in `distilabel` since that's internally handled by the [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline] as part of the output of the `run` method:

```python
from datasets import Dataset
from distilabel.distiset import Distiset

distiset = Distiset(
    {
        "leaf_step_1": Dataset.from_dict({"instruction": [1, 2, 3]}),
        "leaf_step_2": Dataset.from_dict(
            {"instruction": [1, 2, 3, 4], "generation": [5, 6, 7, 8]}
        ),
    }
)
```

!!! NOTE
    If there's only one leaf node, i.e., only one step at the end of the [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline], then the configuration name won't be the name of the last step, but it will be set to "default" instead, as that's more aligned with standard datasets within the Hugging Face Hub.

## Distiset methods

We can interact with the different pieces generated by the [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline] and treat them as different [`configurations`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets-server/configs_and_splits#configurations). The [`Distiset`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset] contains just two methods:

### Train/Test split

Which easily does the train/test split partition of the dataset for the different configurations or subsets.

```python
>>> distiset.train_test_split(train_size=0.9)
Distiset({
    leaf_step_1: DatasetDict({
        train: Dataset({
            features: ['instruction'],
            num_rows: 2
        })
        test: Dataset({
            features: ['instruction'],
            num_rows: 1
        })
    })
    leaf_step_2: DatasetDict({
        train: Dataset({
            features: ['instruction', 'generation'],
            num_rows: 3
        })
        test: Dataset({
            features: ['instruction', 'generation'],
            num_rows: 1
        })
    })
})
```

### Push to Hugging Face Hub

Pushes the [`Distiset`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset] to a Hugging Face repository, where each one of the subsets will correspond to a different configuration:

```python
distiset.push_to_hub(
    "my-org/my-dataset",
    commit_message="Initial commit",
    private=False,
    token=os.getenv("HF_TOKEN"),
)
```

## Dataset card

Having this special type of dataset comes with an added advantage when calling [`Distiset.push_to_hub`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset], which is the automatically generated dataset card in the Hugging Face Hub. Note that it is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting `generate_card=False`:

```python
distiset.push_to_hub("my-org/my-dataset", generate_card=True)
```

We will have an automatic dataset card (an example can be seen [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/distilabel-internal-testing/deita)) with some handy information like reproducing the [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline] with the `CLI`, or examples of the records from the different subsets.


## create_distiset helper

Lastly, we presented in the [caching](./caching.md) section the [`create_distiset`][distilabel.distiset.create_distiset] function, you can take a look at the section to see how to create a [`Distiset`][distilabel.distiset.Distiset] from the cache folder, using the helper function to automatically include all the relevant data.
