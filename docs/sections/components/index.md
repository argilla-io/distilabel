These steps can be thought of as nodes in a graph (a [`Pipeline`][distilabel.pipeline.Pipeline] in `distilabel` is mapped internally to a `Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)`), and can be freely combined to generate synthetic and AI Feedback (AIF) datasets.

This guide can be considered a tutorial, which will guide through the different components of `distilabel`.
