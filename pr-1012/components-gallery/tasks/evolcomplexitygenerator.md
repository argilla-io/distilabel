# EvolComplexityGenerator

Generate evolved instructions with increased complexity using an `LLM`.



`EvolComplexityGenerator` is a generation task that evolves instructions to make
    them more complex, and it is based in the EvolInstruct task, but using slight different
    prompts, but the exact same evolutionary approach.





### Attributes

- **num_instructions**: The number of instructions to be generated.

- **generate_answers**: Whether to generate answers for the instructions or not. Defaults  to `False`.

- **mutation_templates**: The mutation templates to be used for the generation of the  instructions.

- **min_length**: Defines the length (in bytes) that the generated instruction needs to  be higher than, to be considered valid. Defaults to `512`.

- **max_length**: Defines the length (in bytes) that the generated instruction needs to  be lower than, to be considered valid. Defaults to `1024`.

- **seed**: The seed to be set for `numpy` in order to randomly pick a mutation method.  Defaults to `42`.




### Runtime Parameters

- **min_length**: Defines the length (in bytes) that the generated instruction needs to be higher than, to be considered valid.

- **max_length**: Defines the length (in bytes) that the generated instruction needs to be lower than, to be considered valid.

- **seed**: The number of evolutions to be run.



### Input & Output Columns

``` mermaid
graph TD
	subgraph Dataset
		subgraph New columns
			OCOL0[instruction]
			OCOL1[answer]
			OCOL2[model_name]
		end
	end

	subgraph EvolComplexityGenerator
		StepOutput[Output Columns: instruction, answer, model_name]
	end

	StepOutput --> OCOL0
	StepOutput --> OCOL1
	StepOutput --> OCOL2

```




#### Outputs


- **instruction** (`str`): The evolved instruction.

- **answer** (`str`, optional): The answer to the instruction if `generate_answers=True`.

- **model_name** (`str`): The name of the LLM used to evolve the instructions.





### Examples


#### Generate evolved instructions without initial instructions
```python
from distilabel.steps.tasks import EvolComplexityGenerator
from distilabel.llms.huggingface import InferenceEndpointsLLM

# Consider this as a placeholder for your actual LLM.
evol_complexity_generator = EvolComplexityGenerator(
    llm=InferenceEndpointsLLM(
        model_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
    ),
    num_instructions=2,
)

evol_complexity_generator.load()

result = next(scorer.process())
# result
# [{'instruction': 'generated instruction', 'model_name': 'test'}]
```
