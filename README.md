## What's distilabel
distilabel is a framework for AI engineers to align LLM using RLHF-related methods (e.g., reward models, DPO).

The initial focus is LLM fine-tuning and adaptation but we'll be extending it for predictive NLP use cases soon.

Main use cases are:

1. As an AI engineer I want to **build domain-specific instruction datasets** to fine-tune OSS LLMs with increased accuracy.
2. As an AI engineer I want to **build domain-specific and diverse preference datasets** to use RLHF-related methods and align LLMs (e.g, increase the ability to follow instructions or give thruthful responses).

This readme might be outdated the best place to get started is the [documentation](http://distilabel.argilla.io/).

## Quickstart

### Installation

Install with `pip` (requires Python 3.8+):
```sh
pip install distilabel[openai,argilla]
```

### Try it out

After installing, you can immediately start experimenting with `distilabel`:

- **Explore Locally**: Follow the example below to build a preference dataset for DPO/RLHF.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Prefer an interactive experience? Try our Google Colab Notebook!
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rO1-OlLFPBC0KPuXQOeMpZOeajiwNoMy?usp=sharing)

### Example: build a preference dataset for DPO/RLHF
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from distilabel.llm import OpenAILLM
from distilabel.pipeline import pipeline
from distilabel.tasks import TextGenerationTask

# dataset with instructions
dataset = (
    load_dataset("HuggingFaceH4/instruction-dataset", split="test[:5]")
    .remove_columns(["completion", "meta"])
    .rename_column("prompt", "input")
)

# use gpt3.5 turbo for generating responses
task = TextGenerationTask() 

generator = OpenAILLM(
    task=task, 
    max_new_tokens=512
    #openai_api_key="sk-.."
)

# build preference dataset comparing two responses
# focusing on the instruction-following skill
pipe = pipeline("preference", "instruction-following", generator=generator)

dataset = pipe.generate(dataset, num_generations=2)
```

The resulting dataset can already be used for preference tuning (a larger version of it). But beware these AIF dataset are imperfect. To get the most out of AIF feedback, push to Argilla for human feedback:

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(
    api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    api_url="<YOUR_ARGILLA_API_URL>"
)

rg_dataset = dataset.to_argilla()
rg_dataset.push_to_argilla(name="preference-dataset", workspace="admin")
```

## Motivation
üî• Recent projects like [Zephyr](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-6538c6d6d5ddd1cbb1744a66) and [Tulu](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/tulu-v2-suite-6551b56e743e6349aab45101) have shown it's possible to **build powerful open-source models with DPO and AI Feedback** (AIF) datasets. 

üë©‚Äçüî¨ There's a lot of exciting research in the AIF space, such as [UltraFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback) (the dataset leveraged by Zephyr and Tulu), [JudgeLM](https://github.com/baaivision/JudgeLM), or [Prometheus](https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/prometheus-13b-v1.0). 

üöÄ However, going beyond research efforts and applying AIF at scale it's different. For enterprise and production use, we need framework that implements **key AIF methods on a robust, efficient and scalable way**. This framework should enable AI engineers to build custom datasets at scale for their own use cases. 

üë©‚Äçüéì This, combined with humans-in-the-loop for improving dataset quality is the next big leap for OSS LLM models. 

‚öóÔ∏è `distilabel` aims to bridge this gap.

## Key features

* ü§ñ **Leverage OSS models and APIs**: HF Transformers, OpenAI, HF Inference Endpoints, vLLM, LlamaCPP, and more to come.

* üíª **Scalable and extensible**: Scalable implementations of existing methods (e.g., UltraFeedback). Easily extensible to build and configure your own labelers.

* üßë‚Äçü¶± **Human-in-the-loop**: One line of code integration with Argilla to improve and correct datasets.

## Roadmap

- Add Critique Models and support for Prometheus OSS
- Add a generator with multiple models
- Train OSS labelers to replace OpenAI labelers
- Add labelers to evolve instructions generated with self-instruct
- Add labelers for predictive NLP tasks: text classification, information extraction
- Open an issue to suggest a feature!

## How to generate instructions
If you don't have an instruction or prompts dataset you can generate one with our `self-instruct` inspired generator:

```python
import os
from distilabel.tasks import SelfInstructTask
from distilabel.pipeline import Pipeline
from distilabel.llm import OpenAILLM
from datasets import Dataset

math_topics = [
    "Algebraic Expressions",
    "Linear Equations",
    "Quadratic Equations",
    "Polynomial Functions",
    "Rational Expressions",
    "Exponential Functions",
    "Logarithmic Functions",
    "Sequences and Series",
    "Matrices",
    "Determinants",
    #...
]

dataset = Dataset.from_dict({
    "input": math_topics
})

# it will steer the generator
# to generate instructions for this specific app
instruction_task = SelfInstructTask(
    application_description= """
    An AI assistant adept at answering a wide array of math, logic, and reasoning puzzles, trivia, and general questions.
    """,
    num_instructions=10 # 10 instructions per input
)

# default model is: gpt3.5-turbo
# you can choose gpt-4 too
instruction_generator = OpenAILLM(
    task=instruction_task,
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    num_threads=8,
    max_new_tokens=1024
)

pipeline = Pipeline(
    generator=instruction_generator
)

# will generate
distiset = pipeline.generate(
    dataset=dataset,
    # 10 instruction * 10 generations * 10 inputs = 1000 instructions
    num_generations=10, 
    batch_size=4
)
# Output:
# Number of generated instructions: 2044
# 1. Provide an explanation for solving a quadratic equation step by step.
# 2. What is the process for simplifying an algebraic expression with exponents?
# 3. Detail how to factorize a polynomial equation.
# ...
# 10. How can one determine if a given graph represents a linear or quadratic equation?
# 1. How can I simplify the algebraic expression (x^2 + 3x + 2)(2x - 1)?
# 2. Provide step-by-step instructions on how to solve the equation 4(x + 2) - 3 = 7(2x - 1).
# ...
```
