# APIGenSemanticChecker

Generate queries and answers for the given functions in JSON format.



The `APIGenGenerator` is inspired by the APIGen pipeline, which was designed to generate
    verifiable and diverse function-calling datasets. The task generates a set of diverse queries
    and corresponding answers for the given functions in JSON format.





### Attributes

- **system_prompt**: System prompt for the task. Has a default one.

- **exclude_failed_execution**: Whether to exclude failed executions (won't run on those  rows that have a False in `keep_row_after_execution_check` column, which  comes from running `APIGenExecutionChecker`). Defaults to True.





### Input & Output Columns

``` mermaid
graph TD
	subgraph Dataset
		subgraph Columns
			ICOL0[func_desc]
			ICOL1[query]
			ICOL2[answers]
			ICOL3[execution_result]
		end
		subgraph New columns
			OCOL0[thought]
			OCOL1[keep_row_after_semantic_check]
		end
	end

	subgraph APIGenSemanticChecker
		StepInput[Input Columns: func_desc, query, answers, execution_result]
		StepOutput[Output Columns: thought, keep_row_after_semantic_check]
	end

	ICOL0 --> StepInput
	ICOL1 --> StepInput
	ICOL2 --> StepInput
	ICOL3 --> StepInput
	StepOutput --> OCOL0
	StepOutput --> OCOL1
	StepInput --> StepOutput

```


#### Inputs


- **func_desc** (`str`): Description of what the function should do.

- **query** (`str`): Instruction from the user.

- **answers** (`str`): JSON encoded list with arguments to be passed to the function/API.  Should be loaded using `json.loads`.

- **execution_result** (`str`): Result of the function/API executed.




#### Outputs


- **thought** (`str`): Reasoning for the output on whether to keep this output or not.

- **keep_row_after_semantic_check** (`bool`): True or False, can be used to filter  afterwards.
