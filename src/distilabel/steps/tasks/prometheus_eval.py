    aspects: `helpfulness`, `harmlessness`, `honesty`, `factual-validity`, and `reasoning`.

    Note:
        Both `PrometheusAbsEval` and `PrometheusRelEval` tasks are intended to be used with any of the

            needs to be provided within the input data in addition to the rest of the inputs.
        _template: a Jinja2 template used to format the input for the LLM.

    Input columns:
        - instruction (`str`): The instruction to use as reference to understand where the generation comes from.
        - generation (`str`): The generated text from the given `instruction`.
        - reference (`str`, optional): The reference / golden answer for the `instruction`, to be used by the LLM
            for comparison against the `generation`.

    Output columns:
        - feedback (`str`): The feedback for the `generation` based on the given `instruction` critiqued using the
