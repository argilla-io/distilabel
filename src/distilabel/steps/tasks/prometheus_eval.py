class PrometheusEval(Task):
    """Critique and rank the quality of generations from an `LLM` using Prometheus 2.0.

    `PrometheusEval` is a task created for Prometheus 2.0, covering both the absolute and relative
    evaluations.

    - The absolute evaluation i.e. `mode="absolute"` is used to evaluate a single generation from
        an LLM for a given instruction.
    - The relative evaluation i.e. `mode="relative"` is used to evaluate two generations from an LLM
        for a given instruction.

    Both evaluations provide the possibility whether to use a reference answer to compare with or not
    via the `reference` attribute, and both are based on a score rubric that critiques the generation/s
    based on the following default aspects: `helpfulness`, `harmlessness`, `honesty`, `factual-validity`,
    and `reasoning`, that can be overridden via `rubrics`, and the selected rubric is set via the attribute
    `rubric`.

    Note:
        The `PrometheusEval` task is better suited and intended to be used with any of the Prometheus 2.0
        models released by Kaist AI, being: https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-7b-v2.0,
        and https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-8x7b-v2.0. The critique assessment formatting
        and quality is not guaranteed if using another model, even though some other models may be able to
        correctly follow the formatting and generate insightful critiques too.

    Attributes:
        mode: the evaluation mode to use, either `absolute` or `relative`. It defines whether the task
            will evaluate one or two generations.
        rubric: the score rubric to use within the prompt to run the critique based on different aspects.
            Can be any existing key in the `rubrics` attribute, which by default means that it can be:
            `helpfulness`, `harmlessness`, `honesty`, `factual-validity`, or `reasoning`. Those will only
            work if using the default `rubrics`, otherwise, the provided `rubrics` should be used.
        rubrics: a dictionary containing the different rubrics to use for the critique, where the keys are
            the rubric names and the values are the rubric descriptions. The default rubrics are the following:
            `helpfulness`, `harmlessness`, `honesty`, `factual-validity`, and `reasoning`.
        reference: a boolean flag to indicate whether a reference answer / completion will be provided, so
            that the model critique is based on the comparison with it. It implies that the column `reference`
            needs to be provided within the input data in addition to the rest of the inputs.
        _template: a Jinja2 template used to format the input for the LLM.

    Input columns:
        - instruction (`str`): The instruction to use as reference.
        - generation (`str`, optional): The generated text from the given `instruction`. This column is required
            if `mode=absolute`.
        - generations (`List[str]`, optional): The generated texts from the given `instruction`. It should
            contain 2 generations only. This column is required if `mode=relative`.
        - reference (`str`, optional): The reference / golden answer for the `instruction`, to be used by the LLM
            for comparison against.

    Output columns:
        - feedback (`str`): The feedback explaining the result below, as critiqued by the LLM using the
            pre-defined score rubric, compared against `reference` if provided.
        - result (`Union[int, Literal["A", "B"]]`): If `mode=absolute`, then the result contains the score for the
            `generation` in a likert-scale from 1-5, otherwise, if `mode=relative`, then the result contains either
            "A" or "B", the "winning" one being the generation in the index 0 of `generations` if `result='A'` or the
            index 1 if `result='B'`.
        - model_name (`str`): The model name used to generate the `feedback` and `result`.

    Categories:
        - critique
        - preference
