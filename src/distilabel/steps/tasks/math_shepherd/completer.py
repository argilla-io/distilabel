You are a math teacher who helps students by breaking down word problems into clear, logical steps.
When given a problem statement and any number of initial step, generate the remaining steps needed to reach the final answer.
Each step should:

- Build logically on previous steps
- Explain the reasoning in natural language
- Lead to the final answer
- Multiple solution paths are acceptable
- Steps should be concise but clear
- Each calculation should be shown explicitly
- The final answer must be clearly stated
- The number of steps may vary based on the solution approach

# Format requirements:
- Each step should be numbered sequentially, continuing from the last given step
- The final step should clearly state "The answer is: [result]"
- Each step can use different approaches but must be mathematically valid

## Input
Krystian works in the library. He borrows an average of 40 books every day. Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than the daily average. How many books does he borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday?
Step 1: On Friday, Krystian borrows 40 * 0.4 = <<40*0.4=16>>16 more books than on a regular day.

## Output 1
Step 2: On Friday, Krystian borrows 40 + 16 = <<40+16=56>>56 books in total.
Step 3: For the other 4 days (Monday to Thursday), he borrows 40 * 4 = <<40*4=160>>160 books.
Step 4: The total books for the week is 160 + 56 = <<160+56=216>>216. The answer is: 216

## Output 2
Step 2: In total, he borrows 40 + 16 = <<40+16=56>>56 books on Friday.
Step 3: For the whole week (4 regular days plus Friday), the total is (40 * 4) + 56 = <<(40*4)+56=216>>216. The answer is: 216

## Output 3
Step 2: On Friday, he borrows 40 + 40/100 * 40 = <<40+40/100*40=56>>56 books.
Step 3: In a week, he borrows 5.7 * 7 = <<5.7*7=40>>40 books. The answer is: 40"""

    """Math Shepherd Completer and auto-labeller task.

    This task is in charge of, given a list of solutions to an instruction, and a golden solution,
    as reference, generate completions for the solutions, and label them according to the golden
    solution using the hard estimation method from figure 2 in the reference paper, Eq. 3.
    The attributes make the task flexible to be used with different types of dataset and LLMs, and
    allow making use of different fields to modify the system and user prompts for it. Before modifying
    them, review the current defaults to ensure the completions are generated correctly.

    Attributes:
        system_prompt: The system prompt to be used in the completions. The default one has been
            checked and generates good completions using Llama 3.1 with 8B and 70B,
            but it can be modified to adapt it to the model and dataset selected.
        extra_rules: This field can be used to insert extra rules relevant to the type of dataset.
            For example, in the original paper they used GSM8K and MATH datasets, and this field
            can be used to insert the rules for the GSM8K dataset.
        few_shots: Few shots to help the model generating the completions, write them in the
            format of the type of solutions wanted for your dataset.
        N: Number of completions to generate for each step, correspond to N in the paper.
            They used 8 in the paper, but it can be adjusted.
        tags: List of tags to be used in the completions, the default ones are ["+", "-"] as in the
            paper, where the first is used as a positive label, and the second as a negative one.
            This can be updated, but it MUST be a list with 2 elements, where the first is the
            positive one, and the second the negative one.

    Input columns:
        - instruction (`str`): The task or instruction.
        - solutions (`List[str]`): List of solutions to the task.
        - golden_solution (`str`): The reference solution to the task, will be used
            to annotate the candidate solutions.

    Output columns:
        - solutions (`List[str]`): The same columns that were used as input, the "solutions" is modified.
        - model_name (`str`): The name of the model used to generate the revision.

    Categories:
        - text-generation
        - labelling
