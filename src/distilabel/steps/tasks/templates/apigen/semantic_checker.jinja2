Given Information:
- All Available Functions:
{{ func_desc }}
- User Query: {{ query }}
- Generated Function Calls: {{ func_call }}
- Execution Results: {{ execution_result }}

Note: The query may have multiple intentions. Functions may be placeholders, and execution results may be truncated due to length, which is acceptable and should not cause a failure.

The main decision factor is wheather the function calls accurately reflect the query's intentions and the function descriptions.
Provide your reasoning in the thought section and decide if the data passes (answer yes or no).
If not passing, concisely explain your reasons in the thought section; otherwise, leave this section blank.
