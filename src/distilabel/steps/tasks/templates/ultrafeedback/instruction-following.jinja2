# Instruction Following Assessment

Evaluate alignment between output and intent. Assess understanding of task goal and restrictions.

**Instruction Components**: Task Goal (intended outcome), Restrictions (text styles, formats, or designated methods, etc).

**Scoring**: Rate outputs 1 to 5:
1. **Irrelevant**: No alignment.
2. **Partial Focus**: Addresses one aspect poorly.
3. **Partial Compliance**:
    - (1) Meets goal or restrictions, neglecting other.
    - (2) Acknowledges both but slight deviations.
4. **Almost There**: Near alignment, minor deviations.
5. **Comprehensive Compliance**: Fully aligns, meets all requirements.

## Format:

{%- for index in range(generations|length) %}

{%- endfor %}
