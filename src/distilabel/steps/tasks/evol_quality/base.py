    by generating a new response with a language model. This step implements the evolution
    quality task from the paper 'What Makes Good Data for Alignment? A Comprehensive Study of
    Automatic Data Selection in Instruction Tuning'.

    Attributes:
        num_evolutions: The number of evolutions to be performed on the responses.
        store_evolutions: Whether to store all the evolved responses or just the last one.
            Defaults to `False`.
        include_original_response: Whether to include the original response within the evolved
            responses. Defaults to `False`.
        mutation_templates: The mutation templates to be used to evolve the responses.
        seed: The seed to be set for `numpy` in order to randomly pick a mutation method.
            Defaults to `42`.

    Runtime parameters:
        - `seed`: The seed to be set for `numpy` in order to randomly pick a mutation method.

    Input columns:
        - instruction (`str`): The instruction that was used to generate the `responses`.
        - response (`str`): The responses to be rewritten.

    Output columns:
        - evolved_response (`str`): The evolved response if `store_evolutions=False`.
        - evolved_responses (`List[str]`): The evolved responses if `store_evolutions=True`.
        - model_name (`str`): The name of the LLM used to evolve the responses.
