    `ComplexityScorer` is a pre-defined task used to rank a list of instructions based in
    their complexity. It's an implementation of the complexity score task from the paper
    'What Makes Good Data for Alignment? A Comprehensive Study of Automatic Data Selection
    in Instruction Tuning'.

    Attributes:
        _template: a Jinja2 template used to format the input for the LLM.

    Input columns:
        - instructions (`List[str]`): The list of instructions to be scored.

    Output columns:
        - scores (`List[float]`): The score for each instruction.
        - model_name (`str`): The model name used to generate the scores.

    Categories:
        - scorer
        - complexity
        - instruction
