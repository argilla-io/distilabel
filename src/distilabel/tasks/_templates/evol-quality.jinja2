I want you to act as a Response Rewriter
Your goal is to enhance the quality of the response given by an AI assistant
to the #Given Prompt# through rewriting.
But the rewritten response must be reasonable and must be understood by humans.
Your rewriting cannot omit the non-text parts such as the table and code in
#Given Prompt# and #Given Response#. Also, please do not omit the input
in #Given Prompt#.
You Should enhance the quality of the response using the following method:
{{ depth_rewriter }}
You should try your best not to make the #Rewritten Response# become verbose,
#Rewritten Response# can only add 10 to 20 words into #Given Response#.
'#Given Response#', '#Rewritten Response#', 'given response' and 'rewritten response'
are not allowed to appear in #Rewritten Response#
#Given Prompt#:
{{ instruction }}
#Given Response#:
{{ generation }}
#Rewritten Response#:
