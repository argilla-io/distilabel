I want you to act as a Prompt Creator.
Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Prompt# to create a brand new prompt.
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Given Prompt# but must be even more rare.
The LENGTH and complexity of the #Created Prompt# should be similar to that of the #Given Prompt#.
The #Created Prompt# must be reasonable and must be understood and responded by humans.
'#Given Prompt#', '#Created Prompt#', 'given prompt' and 'created prompt' are not allowed to appear in #Created Prompt#
#Given Prompt#:

I want you to act as a Prompt Rewriter.
Your objective is to rewrite a given prompt into a more complex version to make those famous AI systems (e.g., chatgpt and GPT4) a bit harder to handle.
But the rewritten prompt must be reasonable and must be understood and responded by humans.
Your rewriting cannot omit the non-text parts such as the table and code in #The Given Prompt#:. Also, please do not omit the input in #The Given Prompt#.
You SHOULD complicate the given prompt using the following method:
{{ depth_rewriter }}
You should try your best not to make the #Rewritten Prompt# become verbose, #Rewritten Prompt# can only add 10 to 20 words into #The Given Prompt#.
'#The Given Prompt#', '#Rewritten Prompt#', 'given prompt' and 'rewritten prompt' are not allowed to appear in #Rewritten Prompt#
#The Given Prompt#:
