class EvolInstructTask(TextGenerationTask):
    """A `TextGenerationTask` following the `EvolInstruct` specification for building the prompts.

    From the reference repository: *Evol-Instruct is a novel method using LLMs instead of humans to automatically mass-produce
    open-domain instructions of various difficulty levels and skills range, to improve the performance of LLMs.*

    The task is defined as follows:
    Starting from an initial (simpler) instruction, select in-depth or in-breadth evolving to upgrade the simple instruction
    to a more complex one or create a new one (to increase diversity).
    The In-depth Evolving includes the following operations: add constraints, deepening, concretizing and increase reasoning.
    The In-breadth Evolving is mutation, i.e., generating a completely new instruction based on the given instruction.

    Given the evolved instructions are generated from LLMs, sometimes the evolving will fail. We adopt an instruction eliminator
    to filter the failed instructions, called Elimination Evolving, but we don't apply the step of asking again to the LLM it the
    answer is a copy from the same used prompt.

    This evolutionary process can be repeated for several rounds to obtain instruction data containing various complexities.
    Currently the task is implemented as a single step, so to generate multiple evolutions you can "repeat" the instructions
    in the original dataset. An example can be seen at the following script:
    [examples/pipeline-evol-instruct-alpaca.py](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel/tree/main/examples/pipeline-evol-instruct-alpaca.py)

    Args:
        system_prompt (str, optional): the system prompt to be used. Not defined for this task.
